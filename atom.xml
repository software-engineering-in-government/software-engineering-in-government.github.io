			&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-4460 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2020/02/design_system_number_input.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of the new number input guidance&quot; width=&quot;613&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; srcset=&quot;https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2020/02/design_system_number_input.jpg 613w, https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2020/02/design_system_number_input-300x206.jpg 300w, https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2020/02/design_system_number_input-435x298.jpg 435w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;To provide users with a good service, government organisations usually need to collect data. Lots of data. The GOV.UK Design System team creates patterns and components that let users enter their data in an easy and accessible way. The last thing we want to do is create barriers to users completing a task and force them to find an alternative method of using the service, such as phoning a helpline. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Numbers are one of the most commonly asked for pieces of data, typically used in dates. We know from user research that some users prefer the large buttoned number keyboard (resembling a telephone keypad) for entering numbers on mobile. Until now, the GOV.UK Design System date input component used the HTML element &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type=”number”&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to provide this number keypad when a user enters dates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4462&quot; style=&quot;width: 522px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-4462&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4462 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2020/02/number_pad.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A large buttoned keypad used on Android devices&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;351&quot; srcset=&quot;https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2020/02/number_pad.jpg 512w, https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2020/02/number_pad-300x206.jpg 300w, https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2020/02/number_pad-435x298.jpg 435w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4462&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Large buttoned, easy to use number keypad on Android&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;However, we recently moved away from &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type=”number”&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type=”text” inputmode=”numeric” pattern=&quot;[0-9]*&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and published new &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/text-input/#numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;guidance on how to ask users for numbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why type=number is problematic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Although we have user research from 2017 that didn’t flag any major issues with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type=”number”&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, we identified many usability problems with this input type.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Accessibility&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;We found that &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type=”number”&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; :&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;cannot be &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/reported-bugs/issues/34&quot;&gt;dictated or selected when using Dragon Naturally Speaking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;appears as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/reported-bugs/issues/41&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;unlabeled in NVDA&#39;s element list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;appears as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/9675#issuecomment-499977041&quot;&gt;spin button in NVDA&#39;s object navigation, which has an edit field and two buttons inside&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;- those buttons are unlabeled, but decrease/increase the value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;is reported as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/9675#issuecomment-499977041&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;unlabeled edit field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; when using nvda+tab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Incrementable numbers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;reasonable to assume that &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type=”number”&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; can be used for collecting any numeric data: it contains the word “number”, after all. However, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#when-number-is-not-appropriate&quot;&gt;note in the HTML specification&lt;/a&gt; states that &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type=”number”&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is “not appropriate for input that happens to only consist of numbers but isn&#39;t strictly speaking a number”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;This means that &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type=”number”&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; can only be used for incrementable numbers, such as dates or the number of people in a household. Using &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type=”number”&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for collecting numbers that are not incrementable can cause problems with browsers validating them in that way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;For example, browsers attempt to round large numbers when incrementing or decrementing (pressing up or down key), and in the case of very large numbers they are converted to exponential notation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;entry-content-asset&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe title=&quot;Video: Browsers attempt to round large numbers&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;349&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gn6QYu6ro2Y?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Chrome 79.0: type=number displays large numbers in exponential format if user presses the up or down arrows on their keyboard&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Once the number is parsed by the browser as an exponent, as shown above, and possibly by mistake, t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;action cannot be reversed by the user. This could confuse users. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;If users access your site using older versions of Safari, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type=”number”&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; can also be problematic when collecting values of 16 or more digits. In Safari 6, the browser rounds the number when a user leaves the field, so no mistake with up or down keys is required.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;entry-content-asset&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe title=&quot;Video: Safari 6 rounds the last digit on blur&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;465&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1DLsuT-sYLk?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Safari 6 rounds the last digit on blur&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Safari 5.1 attempts to make values with at least 16 digits more readable by inserting commas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;entry-content-asset&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe title=&quot;Video: Safari 5.1 attempting a more human readable number on blur&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;465&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GrZWtCCQquM?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Safari 5.1 attempting a more human readable number on blur&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Letters &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#number-state-(type=number)&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;HTML spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; states that when using &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type=”number”&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, “user agents must not allow the user to set the value to a non-empty string that is not a valid floating-point number”. The web and Android versions of Chrome implement this by silently discarding all letter input except the letter ‘e’.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/w3c/html/issues/1355&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;users are not given feedback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; on what type of characters &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type=”number”&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; accepts, and assistive technologies don’t alert the user that their input has been silently discarded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Scrolling &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Users can accidentally increase or decrease the number using the scroll wheel on the mouse or the scroll gesture on their trackpad. This feature can be useful when collecting countable data but bad if entering data such as passport numbers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The solution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type=”text” inputmode=”numeric” pattern=&quot;[0-9]*&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; allows for a degree of separation between how the user enters data (“input mode”), what the browser expects the user input to contain (type equals number), and potentially how it tries to validate it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Prior to 2019 there wasn’t enough browser support, especially on mobile devices, for us to feel confident in rolling this out instead of using &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type=”number”&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. However the &lt;code&gt;inputmode&lt;/code&gt; attribute is now supported by all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/designing-for-different-browsers-and-devices#browsers-to-test-in&quot;&gt;mobile browsers we test in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;We still include the &lt;code&gt;pattern&lt;/code&gt; attribute for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/StringsTextFonts/Conceptual/TextAndWebiPhoneOS/KeyboardManagement/KeyboardManagement.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;backwards compatibility with older iOS devices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;We’ve now updated the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/date-input/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;date input component &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;and the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/bank-details/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;rest of the relevant patterns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;We’ve also published some &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/text-input/#numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;guidance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; to help users to understand how to collect numbers in HTML forms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Finally, we’ve proposed a change to the HTML spec guidance to cross reference &lt;code&gt;inputmode&lt;/code&gt; when &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#when-number-is-not-appropriate&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;using &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type=”text”&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with content that is only numbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;You can take a look at the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/backlog/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;GOV.UK Design System backlog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; to see what else we’re working on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-4443 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2020/02/GDS_API_event.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Attendees listen to a presentation at the GDS API event&quot; width=&quot;613&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; srcset=&quot;https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2020/02/GDS_API_event.jpg 613w, https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2020/02/GDS_API_event-300x206.jpg 300w, https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2020/02/GDS_API_event-435x298.jpg 435w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;I sit in the Service, Design and Technology Standards programme in the Government Digital Service (GDS) and a lot of my work involves looking at the standards landscape to see how we can improve interoperability within government, especially in the areas of data, APIs and documentation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;This is a collaborative effort and involves relying heavily on thoughts and guidance from the government API and Data Exchange Community of Practice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;The community recently attended a morning of ‘Tech Talks’ at GDS on the topics of interoperability and open standards. The talks were from speakers who are leaders in their space, and helped us open up some of the conversations within the community and consider new goals for what we are trying to achieve. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dan Appelquist: “What’s new in web standards?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;The first speaker was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/torgo&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Dan Appelquist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;, who previously worked at GDS on Open Standards, while also contributing to the Government API Standards. Dan is Head of Developer Advocacy for Samsung Internet, co-chair of the W3C Technical Architecture Group, and continues to be a member of the UK Government Open Standards Board. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;One of my first take-aways from Dan’s talk was that as government, we have enormous potential to get involved in discussions on web standards taking place in the W3C community and to help set web standards. Something we should be doing more, as part of our focus on open data standards, is joining these discussions and helping to make sure they meet the needs of government users. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Dan also discussed data ethics, and encouraged attendees to consider aspects such as accessibility, internationalisation, privacy, and security on the web. He shared the W3C Technical Architecture Ethical Web Principles he worked on, and reiterated the need for the web to prioritise the needs of the marginalised over the comfort of the privileged, an ethic GDS is strongly focused on. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;For example, when designing new services, it’s important to consider some users will be using low bandwidth networks and low spec phones and devices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lorna Mitchell: “Introduction to OpenAPI”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lornajane&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Lorna Mitchell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; is a Developer Advocate for Nexmo, and regularly talks about how useful she finds the OpenAPI spec for her work there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Last year the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2019/10/02/improve-csvs-and-api-descriptions-with-these-open-standards-board-recommendations/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Open Standards Board passed OpenAPI 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; as a standard for the rest of government to use, but purely for documentation purposes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;What Laura helped us all understand is that there is tremendous value in also using the spec for design-first purposes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;She walked us through the tools that can work with Open API 3 to do this. Ideally this design would involve collaboration between the writer, the software engineering team and the product manager. Lorna also showed us how Open API can help you poke around with unfamiliar APIs.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Lorna also encouraged the audience to use metadata descriptions for their APIs, as these descriptions were essential to the findability of the API online. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kin Lane: “An API-first structure”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kinlane&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Kin Lane&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; describes himself as an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/apievangelist&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;API Evangelist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; for all APIs. Kin is most known for his work with the US government as a consultant and as the Presidential Innovation Fellow for the US Department of Veterans Affairs. He is currently the Chief Evangelist at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getpostman.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Postman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Kin built on Lorna’s talk, discussing how API design-first is essential to an organisation’s API strategy. An API-first structure helps you prioritise users and deliver better quality APIs for use across desktop, web, mobile, and device applications. ‘API mocking’ and using a design spec like OpenAPI ensures that the people and processes that engage with these applications are considered throughout their development and evolution. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;The other important take-away I took from Kin’s talk was that it’s important for API development teams to tell the story of what their API does. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;It’s easy for development teams to get bogged down in the technical and delivery detail but Kin was very clear that they need to tell the wider story of what their API will bring to government or government users. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;While it is true that APIs are often a very technical and abstract concept which requires a more technically-inclined individual to engage, APIs are something that impacts everyone - business users and developers - across today&#39;s digital landscape.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-4442 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2020/02/tweet_api_event.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tweet from Daniel Appelquist that says &amp;quot;One of the best insights from @kinlane&#39;s talk on Open APIs at today&#39;s GDS tech talk was the importance of stories &amp;amp; storytelling in building &amp;amp; maintaining an ecosystem around APIs in any organisation. Storytelling is such an important part of the advocacy toolkit – in any area.&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;591&quot; height=&quot;306&quot; srcset=&quot;https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2020/02/tweet_api_event.jpg 591w, https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2020/02/tweet_api_event-300x155.jpg 300w, https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2020/02/tweet_api_event-435x225.jpg 435w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come along to our next data exchange event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;We are holding an event on 16 March in London with the National Archives to discuss long-term data management.

			&lt;p&gt;by Bethan Palmer and Mat Moore (Software Development Profession)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QcjI9ASxo9cvQ6HgEOtZYA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In LAA digital, we are moving towards Continuous Delivery as part of modernising CCMS (Client and Cost Management System). CCMS is one of several &lt;a href=&quot;https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/2018/11/22/announcing-the-application-modernisation-team1/&quot;&gt;legacy services we are modernising in the MOJ&lt;/a&gt;. So far we have been focusing mainly on one part of CCMS, the Provider User Interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Continuous Delivery is the ability to get changes of all types — including new features, configuration changes, bug fixes and experiments — into production, or into the hands of users, &lt;em&gt;safely&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt; in a &lt;em&gt;sustainable&lt;/em&gt; way. &lt;a href=&quot;https://continuousdelivery.com/&quot;&gt;https://continuousdelivery.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, the deployment process for CCMS has involved a lot of steps, and a lot of different people need to be involved throughout the process to get a change from development to production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*2r-rXfkc_EsYi_hr&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a release process is complex and time consuming, releases happen infrequently. Because they happen infrequently they are risky as they contain a lot of changes. And because they are risky they tend to happen even less often. So there becomes a cycle of infrequent releases which is difficult to break out of. We wanted to avoid this situation by moving towards frequent deployments to production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Things that we want to change&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottlenecks in the deployment process were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deployments needed to be planned, and required approval from various people to proceed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We needed to do a lot of manual testing, and our case workers or the live support team also manually smoke tested each deployment to make sure we hadn’t broken anything&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We needed to run separate builds for each environment we deploy to, instead of building a single artefact and deploying it to each environment in turn&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We had to develop the code in a shared development environment, which was firewalled off from the internet and difficult to work on&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are working to remove these bottlenecks so that we can deploy to production quickly and easily. Our end goal is to promote changes from the development environment through to production in less than 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What we’ve done so far&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are some of the changes we’ve made which are helping us move towards Continuous Delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Updated the unit tests&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were already some existing unit tests, but several of them contained hardcoded paths to configuration files we didn’t have access to. We re-wrote some of these tests, removed some of them, and wrote some new unit tests to increase our test coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Added CircleCI (continuous integration)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We added an integration with CircleCI, which runs our unit tests every time we create a Pull Request in GitHub. It also checks our code’s dependencies for security vulnerabilities every night. Eventually we want to automate deployments from here too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Written some end to end tests&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve written some browser tests that automate someone clicking through the application. Running these gives us confidence that our changes haven’t broken any of the basic functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Improved the application build process&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have replaced the old Ant build with a new Gradle build. Ant and Gradle are both build automation tools for Java applications, but Gradle has several advantages over Ant. For example with Gradle we are able to delete checked in dependencies and use remote ones, making it much easier to upgrade them. Gradle is a simpler tool for developers to use and the build process is quicker, which makes developing code changes easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Created a Docker/Tomcat build we can run locally&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are now able to build the application and deploy it to Tomcat running in a Docker container. This means we can develop and test our changes locally instead of relying on the shared development environment, which is very difficult to use. This gives us a much quicker feedback loop when doing development work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Spiked out what our ideal deployment pipeline into AWS might look like&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ministryofjustice/deployment-pipeline-hello-world&quot;&gt;spike to demonstrate how our end goal might work with a simple Hello World application&lt;/a&gt;. This involved creating a pipeline in CircleCI that builds the app, tests it, and deploys it to multiple environments in AWS with zero downtime. We also want to look at spinning up ephemeral environments that get deleted after a certain amount of time. Another department in the MoJ, the Office of the Public Guardian, had already created a similar deployment pipeline so we were able to use their work as a guideline for ours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Next steps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Migrate to AWS&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCMS could not be included in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/just-tech/reducing-cost-and-latency-of-change-for-legacy-services-5ab85a0f339f&quot;&gt;our previous migration to AWS&lt;/a&gt;. Now that we have a better understanding of the process, we intend to repeat the same steps to move CCMS out of the current data centre and deploy into public cloud. This will reduce the cost of running the service, but will also allow us to run fully automated deployments. This enables us to make changes more quickly and safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Increase our test coverage&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our test coverage is still very low (6% for the Provider User Interface). We want to increase this so that we have less reliance on manual testing, and can be confident we are releasing changes safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Adopt Continuous Deployment&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we have achieved Continuous Delivery, the next step is to move to Continuous Deployment (where the release is automated from CircleCI rather than a manual process, and there is zero downtime).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoyed this article, please feel free to hit the👏 clap button and leave a response below.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;The agenda is now &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/api-community-meet-up-newcastle-tickets-74084931023&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;live on our Eventbrite page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; and contains a good selection of technical and strategic talks, as well as some case studies and a panel discussion. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;API reuse discussions on the agenda &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;I’m particularly looking forward to the discussions on API reuse. When &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2019/10/11/add-your-api-to-the-cross-government-catalogue/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;launching the government API catalogue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; a few weeks ago, we cited one of its core objectives as helping improve transparency of API development across government. That it has done, with even the few APIs that have been added already. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;What the catalogue could also potentially do is get API development teams thinking about how components they design can be reused across government. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;But the question is how much is API reuse even possible, and what are we talking about when discussing reuse? API reuse could refer to:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;API processes, like how clients do testing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;API functionality, like the access rights and security policies implemented, or the documentation template used &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;the data sets the APIs call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;the whole API, like is the case with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;GOV.UK Pay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;GOV.UK Notify&lt;/a&gt;, which are both treated as products each time they are deployed by a government organisation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;At the meetup, we’ll be hearing from DWP and HMRC on what kind of API reuse they think is possible, and what API development teams should be thinking about when developing an API with reuse in mind. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suppliers welcome at this meetup&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;We’ve held quite a few API meetups in recent years but this is the first time we’ve given suppliers a voice in the agenda and really tried to make them feel welcome. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;It’s important we involve suppliers working on APIs in the public sector so we can &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;learn from suppliers’ cross-government views and approaches as they implement similar APIs in many different departments. This will also &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;ensure suppliers follow the same thinking and best practices as the rest of the cross-government API and data exchange community. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll also &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;hear from more niche suppliers in areas such as API management on what they think the future will hold for tooling - we’ll be holding a panel at the event on the future of API management to try to get some thoughts in this particular area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A good mix of technical and strategic talks &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;The API meetups we’ve been holding for the last couple of years have been slowly changing from more technical discussions (as we tried to nail down the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Government API standards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; and the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/api-design-guidance&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;accompanying guidance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;) to more strategic discussions (as more departments are launching full API strategies). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;At this event, we’ve tried to ensure a mix of both technical and strategic talks so the event can appeal to all of those in the API community, from the technical architects and the rest of the API design team, to those in senior management setting the API strategies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;This meetup will focus on some more technical and practical areas, like how we, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;best support clients to test our APIs, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;think about designing data APIs and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;do user research for APIs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;We’ll then be moving on to some strategic discussions, like how &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;the Ministry of Defence (MOD) is moving to an API First organisation. We&#39;ll also hear how &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;the Italian government is working with the API international standards community and how &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Newcastle is using APIs as an asset. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;DWP will present on how it&#39;s using APIs to transform its organisation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Join the Government API and data exchange community&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Our event on 13 November is unfortunately already sold out but please &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:api-data-request@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;email us if you would like to join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; the waiting list for the event and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;the Government API and data exchange community. Being part of the community means you will be kept updated on more events like this. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;The full agenda of the event is below. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agenda&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;09:30am to 10am: &lt;/span&gt;Coffee and networking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;10am to 10:10am: &lt;/span&gt;Welcome&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;, Rosalie Marshall, Government Digital Service (GDS)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;10:10am to 10:30am : &lt;/span&gt;4 ways we’re improving API and data exchange capability&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;, Rosalie Marshall (GDS)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;An update from GDS on the launch of the API catalogue, new guidance on API management and API principles, the data standards work and the updated API standards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;10:30am to 10:50am: &lt;/span&gt;API user research for COGS&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;, Alex Tucker and Bill Roberts (Office for National Statistics and Swirrl)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Where we are with API user research and design for the Connected Open Government Statistics project with ONS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;10:50am to 11am: &lt;/span&gt;API Reuse: how straightforward is it?&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; Richard Baines (HMRC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;The ability to reuse APIs is often cited as a potential benefit to creating them, but is it as clear cut as it seems? Some lessons from HMRC’s experience in implementing its API strategy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;11am to 11:25am: &lt;/span&gt;The Benefits API: a case study on cross-government working&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;, Jacqui Leggetter (DWP)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;A talk from DWP on the Benefits API between DWP and NHS, covering its reusable components and its benefits to the Blue Badge Scheme.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;11:25am to 11:40am: &lt;/span&gt;An Ofgem API case study&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Deborah Fehindemi (Ofgem) and Valtech speaker TBC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;11:40am to 12pm: &lt;/span&gt;Supporting API clients&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;, David Heath (GOV.UK Pay)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;A talk from GOV.UK Pay on how to support the development process of clients using your API.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;12pm to 12:20pm: &lt;/span&gt;Designing data APIs&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;, Simon Worthington and Andy Bennet (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Register Dynamics) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-4288 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2019/10/API-catalogue2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;613&quot; height=&quot;311&quot; srcset=&quot;https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2019/10/API-catalogue2.jpg 613w, https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2019/10/API-catalogue2-300x152.jpg 300w, https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2019/10/API-catalogue2-435x221.jpg 435w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;We’re inviting government organisations (both local and central) to post details of their APIs on GitHub so we can improve the picture we have of development taking place across government and the types of data sharing occurring. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why we need more transparency and consistency in the API space&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Even though there’s more cross-government working in the API space than ever before, there are still many cases of government organisations developing APIs in isolation. This can lead to the government solving the same problem multiple times, often in different ways. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;GDS, along with the API and Data Exchange cross-government community, maintains a set of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;API Standards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/api-design-guidance&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;API design guidance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;, and holds regular API events, all in order to agree common standards and the sharing of best practice. Collaborating on a list of APIs should create more transparency in the development space, and should further help government &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;development teams communicate with each other about challenges and approaches. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Publishing an open list of government APIs is an approach increasingly common internationally. At a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2019/05/22/10-things-we-learned-from-our-api-community-of-practice-event/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;recent API event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;, Canada’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Office of the Chief Information Officer presented on its cross-government &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://api.canada.ca/en/homepage&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;API Store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;The Canadian API Store is a catalogue of government APIs to increase findability, and is a collaborative effort across government. Users can discover services or data through the API Store to help the Canadian government’s ‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/news/2018/02/the_government_ofcanadaislaunchingatellusonceapproachforonlinedi.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;tell us once&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; pro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;gramme of work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Other governments running similar projec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;ts include the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/18F/api.data.gov/blob/master/data/apis.yml&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;US government&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; 18F delivery service, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://api.gouv.fr/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;French government&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;, and the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apistore.regione.umbria.it/store/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Italian regional government of Umbria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to add your API to the collaborative catalogue&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;We’ve outlined the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/api-catalogue/blob/master/TERMS_OF_USE.md&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Terms of Use for the API Catalogue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; in the GitHub repository to give a clear understanding of how the API Catalogue will work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Adding your API to the catalogue is quick and easy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Open a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/api-catalogue/issues&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;GitHub Issue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Include a link to your API’s base URL and documentation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Submit the GitHub issue for review.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;GDS will review the API Catalogue regularly, respond to Issues and close Issues with APIs that do not follow the Terms of Use. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;The catalogue &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;is limited to APIs that exist between government organisations, or between government organisations and industry, or that publish open data. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How you can feedback on this work&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;We will run a feedback session at one of the next API events to see how departments and local government find contributing to the list. Our next API meetup is in Newcastle and will be hosted by DWP and open to both government employees and suppliers. If you want to attend, you can &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/api-community-meet-up-newcastle-tickets-74084931023&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;sign up on the Eventbrite page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Alternatively you can reach out to us in the comments below or send an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:api-standards-request@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;email to our Service, Design and Assurance team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3365 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2018/09/open-standards-board-620x436.png&quot; alt=&quot;Make things open it makes them better&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;436&quot; srcset=&quot;https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2018/09/open-standards-board-620x436.png 620w, https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2018/09/open-standards-board-620x436-300x211.png 300w, https://technology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2018/09/open-standards-board-620x436-435x306.png 435w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Over the summer, the Open Standards Board received proposals for a standard and specification. Contributors suggested an open standard to make it easier for the government to publish and reuse data, and an open specification to promote the consistent and accurate description of RESTful APIs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;The Open Standards Board reviewed and approved both proposals and now recommends using the:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recommended-open-standards-for-government/tabular-data-standard&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;RFC 4180 standard to publish tabular data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recommended-open-standards-for-government/describing-restful-apis-with-openapi-3&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;OpenAPI 3 specification for RESTful API descriptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why the RFC 4180 standard&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;The comma separated values (CSV) format is a popular way to exchange columns of numbers and text between software. CSV is used for publishing data tables on GOV.UK, often alongside a spreadsheet. The lack of a standard for CSV files can cause problems for people trying to reuse published data. This prompted a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/open-standards/issues/58&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;challenge on GitHub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; calling for the standardisation of CSV. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;The challenge owner, David Read, Technical Architect at MoJ and contributors worked together to develop a profile of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;RFC 4180, an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Internet Engineering Task Force (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;IETF) specification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;, after extensive discussions on the GitHub page.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;The IETF RFC 4180 is a simple document describing a standard format for CSV files. While the RFC leaves some items in the standard as optional, the profile selected by the challenge owner specifies how the standard should be used. For example, character encoding must be UTF-8 and a header row should be included with the data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;This standard allows the use of CSV files in a wide selection of software tools without editing them first. The consistent formatting makes government open data easier for people to use and saves data analysts’ time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Describing RESTful APIs with OpenAPI 3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Another challenge was submitted to use the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/open-standards/issues/31&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;OpenAPI version 3 to describe RESTful APIs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;The proposal was originally raised in 2016 but was deemed as too new, did not have enough supporting tools, and it was not clear if it would be supported by users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;The Open Standards Board reviewed this challenge again after the specification matured. The board did not mandate the specification as it’s not suitable for all types of APIs but has recommended its use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;OpenAPI 3 is important because it can help users to:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;generate accurate up to date &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/writing-api-reference-documentation&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;API reference documentation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;, no matter what programming language an API is written in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;validate, version, maintain and update this generated documentation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;use a consistent API description to help increase adoption of APIs across government by reducing time spent understanding different APIs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Before the Board’s decision to recommend OpenAPI 3, GDS technical writer Jon Glassman carried out further research to confirm: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;OpenAPI 3 was the most common way to describe RESTful APIs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;the tooling for OpenAPI 3 had continued to develop and evolve &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;the majority of concerns raised previously were no longer valid and people were happy to recommend OpenAPI 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;There are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openapi.tools/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;multiple OpenAPI tools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; available. For example, you can send test requests to your API endpoints using different methods in the interactive API explorer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;The aim is to encourage API teams to produce definition files in a format that is readable by machines and language-agnostic. No matter what language developers are working in, they will be able to understand the API and what it can do. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;It’s important to remember that this specification only applies to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;describing APIs and generating API reference information. Complete API documentation also covers information like quick start guides and API keys. This is covered by our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/api-design-guidance&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;API guidance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to propose an open standard&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;If you know of an issue where an open standard for cross-government use will make things better you can submit a proposal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/open-standards/issues&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Visit our GitHub issues page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Suggest a standard or specification that fits a user need or open a challenge to discover which standards to use in a particular situation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;The community will assess and comment on the standard’s openness, applicability and maturity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;You will then need to put forward a proposal to the Open Standards Board, which will make the final decision. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

We process data from a plethora of sources, from decades-old database systems through to microservices on our Cloud Platform. Our data needs to be quickly delivered to live webapps, and analysts who use R, Python, and Spark. This variety means we need to find a good tradeoff between consistency and flexibility in data processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more we work on this problem, the more we understand the importance of tools that standardise our data processing, transforming data sources from arcane, unreliable formats into dependable, reusable commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central to this effort is the development of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/metadata_schema&quot;&gt;standard for machine readable metadata&lt;/a&gt;, and the realisation that once this exists, it is useful in almost every stage of the data pipeline:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The metadata can serve as specification for data providers, who can easily use our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/data_linter&quot;&gt;open source library&lt;/a&gt; to check conformance of their data against the spec, knowing we will be applying exactly the same checks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At data ingestion, we can automate multiple checks of whether the incoming data conforms to the metadata, yielding detailed web reports of rows which failed the checks. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/moj-analytical-services/data_linter_demo/master?filepath=index.ipynb&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a simple demo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;During data processing, we can automatically harmonise the wide variety of incoming column data types (string, float, int etc.) from different database systems into a common set.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We can automatically convert our system-agnostic metadata into the format required by specific data storage solutions, automating the process of setting up databases. This makes it trivial, for instance, to generate the code needed to setup an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/etl_manager/blame/master/README.md#L187&quot;&gt;AWS Athena Database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The metadata can be automatically added to a central, searchable data catalogue, enabling data discoverability. We have developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/metadata_vis&quot;&gt;an open source GUI&lt;/a&gt; on top of our metadata to enable easy searching and automated SQL query generation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since the metadata for a particular table is just a json file, it can be placed under version control. The metadata is a necessary part of our ETL code, and so it lives in the same repository, meaning metadata stays in sync with the code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally, authoring metadata is simple and fast. Taking inspiration from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jsonschema.net/&quot;&gt;jsonschema generator&lt;/a&gt; we can automatically generate a first draft of metadata from existing datasets, and use of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/metadata_schema&quot;&gt;metadata schema &lt;/a&gt;enables &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings&quot;&gt;autocompletion&lt;/a&gt; of manual edits in text editors like VS Code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A simple example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have developed an online, interactive demo of some of our tools, which you can find &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/moj-analytical-services/data_linter_demo/master?filepath=index.ipynb&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This notebook demonstrates how we can:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Produce a validation report of a dataset which validates successfully against a metadata schema&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Produce a validation report of a dataset which fails to validate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Auto-create a draft metadata schema from an existing dataset&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=f70c9c57bd13&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/just-tech/bringing-disparate-data-sources-under-control-with-good-metadata-f70c9c57bd13&quot;&gt;Bringing Disparate Data Sources Under Control with Good Metadata&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/just-tech&quot;&gt;Just Tech&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;by Andrew Pearce (Web Operations Profession)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ijx4dhkbnW5S-ZLTASVk1w.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use Terraform to provision AWS infrastructure for an application. The app has 3 environments - development, preproduction and production - that have the same configuration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terraform workspaces are used to isolate the resources and to map certain values, such as what AWS account to provision to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/731/0*x7VTHNT_4S3M3jDl&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Variable definitions using tfvars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variable definitions let you set values for lots of variables at once. They can read in automatically when you run a terraform apply or terraform plan instead of individually providing them with -var=.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can provide values in Terraform’s syntax with terraform.tfvars files, or in JSON format with terraform.tfvars.json.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;terraform.tfvars.json files are how I provide values specific to each environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been doing this for a while, but I recently found a new way to organise, define and access these values thanks to some improvements in the underlying Terraform language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My old way of organising variables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to define maps for each variable. Each map held values for dev, preprod and prod:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*uqaePv5qIHMmWNp-&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;My tfvars.json had a lot of repeating dev, preprod, prod stanzas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*WWnoc8ADoN0id2jX&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would then access my values for each environment using a lookup function, matching the name of the environment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*hmF6ODORYm46ie_A&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does have the advantage of being able to supply a default when the lookup fails to return a match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My new way of organising variables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I am using objects to define many values:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*zDiK-aW19ejBvgUO&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variables can now be organised by environment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*1-q1mZnBwusxxV9a&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Values can now be accessed from the object using the environment name, which here is available in terraform.workspace:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*mMJ3PaFy6yk0YDCY&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*RMG5rNXDupfDVFDD&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still have a need for variable maps, and the two can live alongside each other in the terraform.tfvars.json file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*F1zRlFI6q8jxW-ld&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why I prefer this&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For my purposes, this is much neater and easier to read. All the parameters for each environment are grouped together. Adding another environment would be as easy as copying the block and updating as necessary instead of adding a new line to each variable map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can’t speak to the performance improvements for terraform, but it has made my work faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can read a full implementation of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-lpa/tree/master/terraform/terraform_environment&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoyed this article, please feel free to hit the👏 clap button and leave a response below.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gov.uk/&quot;&gt;GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt; is the main portal to government for citizens. It enables users to interact with government in a number of situations, from applying for their first driving licence to checking foreign travel advice before jetting off into the sun. With all of the content that’s required to support these tasks, it can be hard for users to find the relevant content they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help users get to the information they need, GOV.UK uses a number of navigational aids – one of them being related links. Related links are shown to the right-hand side of content on a page, linking to other pages which may be of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently only around 2% of the entire content on GOV.UK, or 8,000 pages, actually have related links. The rest have no related links at all. This matters because observation and analytics tell us that good related links result in shorter user journeys, enabling users to find the content that they need faster and with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-6984 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-06-26-at-20.46.41-620x323.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of a GOV.UK page with related content links highlighted on the right-hand side&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;323&quot; srcset=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-06-26-at-20.46.41-620x323.png 620w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-06-26-at-20.46.41-310x162.png 310w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-06-26-at-20.46.41-768x401.png 768w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-06-26-at-20.46.41-435x227.png 435w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to improve users’ experience, we investigated whether we could use machine learning on GOV.UK to generate related links for the remaining 98% of content that had none. As a result of this experiment, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2019/06/19/a-or-b-how-we-test-algorithms-on-gov-uk/&quot;&gt;we decided to implement the node2vec algorithm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The journey to productionising related links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To productionise, at its simplest, can simply mean to move some algorithm or software into an environment where it’s used to shape the outcome of a process, later consumed by users. When applied to data science, this involves creating a joined-up and automated pipeline from individual steps, such as obtaining input data, running a machine learning algorithm and creating useful output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing such a system for GOV.UK required considering a number of different problem areas to find the best trade-offs for GOV.UK itself, for GDS, and for similar projects within wider government in the future. In this post, you will read about just a few of the considerations we needed to make during the course of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hosting and running machine learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first choice we had to make was how we’d host the node2vec machine learning algorithm. Many cloud providers offer what’s called a virtual machine, which – to make an analogy – is simply a computer in the cloud. You can use it to install code libraries, run your machine learning and store the results somewhere. Virtual machines are popular and used widely throughout industry, including to host GOV.UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A popular alternative to virtual machines is serverless. Serverless is a model in which you don’t need to worry about how you host your application – meaning the infrastructure on which it runs. Serverless can host everything from fully-fledged websites to ad-hoc, infrequent tasks, alleviating the need for maintenance of the operating system on which it runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose to use a virtual machine for hosting our machine learning algorithm. Serverless is a popular and exciting technology but our development process for it isn’t fully defined. Virtual machines also act as a stepping stone towards running our applications in containers (think Docker), something that we’re actively looking into at GDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jupyter notebooks meet Python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data scientists at GDS use &lt;a href=&quot;https://jupyter.org&quot;&gt;Jupyter&lt;/a&gt; notebooks for the rapid development and prototyping of solutions to data science problems. In particular, it allows code, documentation and data to live in a single place, which helps to improve both understanding and knowledge sharing between colleagues. From a developer perspective, it’s analogous to an integrated development environment (IDE), like that of Visual Studio or IntelliJ – a tool which makes the process of writing high-quality software easier through various integrations such as offering code optimisations and providing real-time debugging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To automate the process of generating related links, we decided to modularise the code from the Jupyter notebooks and write it in object-oriented Python. We borrowed the approach of test-driven development (TDD) from software engineering to focus the development process and ensure functional code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ensuring quality links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our goals was to automate the process of generating related links. To do this, it’s necessary to have confidence in the entire process – both now and in the future. Our related links are based on a combination of how pages on GOV.UK are linked to each other and users’ behaviour on the site over a number of weeks. This means we’ll always be adapting the links we’re generating and the pages we’re generating them for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to ensure a high quality of related links on GOV.UK, we added a number of steps to our process. Firstly, there are a number of pages that we never want to generate related links for or to, which we exclude at both the input and output stages of the link generation process. Next, we apply a confidence threshold to the links generated by node2vec, only allowing through those links that have a good chance of being relevant for a particular page. Finally, we generate a spreadsheet of the top 200 most popular pages, allowing our content designers to critique the related links that have been assigned to these pages and make changes where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rolling back links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of productionising related links, another issue that needed consideration was what should happen if things go wrong, particularly with regards to the links that we suggest to users. This was an important consideration as GOV.UK is the digital face of government, meaning we need to ensure accuracy and relevancy at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, we decided to create and store suggested links alongside existing related links for each content item, using a new property in the content schema. This was how we implemented our A/B tests and allowed us to switch between the control and test variants of related links via our content delivery network (CDN). We implemented a similar mechanism (called an &lt;a href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html#OpsToggles&quot;&gt;operations toggle&lt;/a&gt;) via our CDN to show suggested related links. This allows us to switch off these links sitewide, which might be necessary if we detect a batch of bad links has been ingested, or similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-6983 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/08/related_links_team-620x413.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;photo of four members of the Related Links team all viewing a computer screen&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;413&quot; srcset=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/08/related_links_team-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/08/related_links_team-310x207.jpg 310w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/08/related_links_team-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/08/related_links_team-435x290.jpg 435w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/08/related_links_team.jpg 2000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Generating related links as standard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since completing the work to productionise related links, we have been running the process every three weeks and using the links generated to update our content store. Our generated related links are automatically displayed on GOV.UK when publishers haven’t set their own links, ensuring we do as much as possible to help users find the content they’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re continuously iterating and refining the related links process, and monitoring results to ensure users’ experiences are improving. In the future, there’s the opportunity that we can bring the model online and use it as part of the publishing process, helping editors creating new content to add relevant related links. All of our code is available to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-related-links-recommender&quot;&gt;view on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But with new technology, there are now more things to take into consideration. One such issue that arose with Docker is image size. Traditionally, to get an efficient docker image, you would use some complex shell commands within the Dockerfile to keep the layers as small as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Docker 17.05, multi-stage builds were introduced and this means we can now make docker images even smaller. Below, I’m going to go over an example of how to do this with a Symfony app and composer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With multi-stage builds, you can use multiple FROM commands within a single Dockerfile. Each FROM command can use a different base and symbolises a new stage in the build. The most useful thing is that you can selectively copy artefacts from one stage to another leaving everything that you don’t need behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let’s create a new Dockerfile and add our first FROM command. This will be using composer as a base image, so we can get all of our composer dependencies. We can also name the different stages within the build by adding AS &amp;lt;NAME&amp;gt; to the FROM command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;FROM composer AS composer&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let’s copy over our composer.json and composer.lock files. We’re also going to add a RUN command, which will run a composer install.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;FROM composer AS composer&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;COPY composer.json /app&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;COPY composer.lock /app&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;RUN composer install&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the first part of our multi-stage build is done, this will allow us to install our composer dependencies into the first image and then copy them across into the final image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to build our final stage:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;FROM php:7-fpm-alpine&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;WORKDIR /var/www&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;COPY ./ /app&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;COPY — from=composer /app/vendor /app/vendor&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we start a new build using php7-fpm-alpine as the base image, then we use COPY to copy over the vendor folder into our new image. We leave all the composer gubbins behind, and it’s not saved into our final image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full Dockerfile looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;FROM composer AS composer&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;COPY composer.json /app&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;COPY composer.lock /app&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;RUN composer install&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;FROM php:7-fpm-alpine&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;WORKDIR /var/www&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;COPY ./ /app&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;COPY — from=composer /app/vendor /app/vendor&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You only need a single Dockerfile. Just run docker build and docker the build process will start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end result of using multi-stage builds is a slim production-ready image without any complexity. I hope you can see the benefits of using multi-stage builds and I would definitely encourage you to try them out!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoyed this article, please feel free to hit the👏 clap button and leave a response below.

As bank holidays are moved or created to coincide with key national events (Royal Weddings for example), a simple calculation or static data lookup is not a good long term solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, a solution is described that gathers bank holiday data from a GOV-UK API, and uses that data to calculate working day intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A Ruby Solution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of gems that will do working day calculations, but to keep them up-to-date they require a list of bank holidays to be passed into them. They make the calculation simpler, but a system to gather bank holiday data is still required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The API&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays.json&quot;&gt;GOV-UK API&lt;/a&gt; that returns up-to-date bank holiday data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Gem selection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were three main gems considered:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Intrepidd/working_hours&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;working_hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bokmann/business_time&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;business_time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gocardless/business&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;business&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of these, &lt;em&gt;business_time&lt;/em&gt; was last update two years ago. The other two gems both appear to be more regularly maintained. Both &lt;em&gt;business_time&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;working_hours&lt;/em&gt; monkey patch the core Ruby time objects &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Date&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;DateTime&lt;/em&gt;. As the scope of usage for this project was limited (there was currently only one calculation to be made), using a gem that didn’t monkey patch core objects was a better fit. That left the &lt;em&gt;business&lt;/em&gt; gem — and this was selected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Retrieving the data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first task was to create a service that would retrieve the data from the API. The solution was &lt;em&gt;BankHolidayRetriever&lt;/em&gt;, which called the API via Net::HTTP.get_response, parsed the resulting JSON and extracted the array of dates from the required section of the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/media/7844a68615efc21f884bbff72e1aa9b6/href&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/media/7844a68615efc21f884bbff72e1aa9b6/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Storing the data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next task was to store the data to locally cache it. After some consideration as to whether to store the data in memory, or in a memcache, it was decided to use the simplest solution of storing the data in the database via an &lt;em&gt;ActiveRecord Model&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model was created with a generator:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;rails g model BankHoliday dates:text&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was then modified to add serialization of dates to store the array coming from BankHolidayRetriever.dates, some simple validation, and a callback that populated dates on creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/media/81aeaa371753c89626ad5acfb2080fa6/href&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/media/81aeaa371753c89626ad5acfb2080fa6/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;A class method BankHoliday.dates was added that would retrieve the latest updated instance of the model and return its dates, or create an instance if none exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also added to the dates class method call, was a call out to a worker that would update the current data. In this way the bank holiday data will be updated as it is used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The update worker&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Sidekiq&lt;/em&gt; was available in the current project, a worker was added that will update the Bank Holiday data. Its first task is to see when the last update occurred. If the last update is less than a certain interval old (currently two days), the worker would just close without doing an update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If an update is required, the worker uses a new instance of &lt;em&gt;BankHoliday&lt;/em&gt; to gather the latest data. It then compares that data with the latest stored data. If the two match, the “updated at” date of the last persisted &lt;em&gt;BankHoliday&lt;/em&gt; instance is updated (via touch).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the latest stored data does not match the retrieved data, then the new instance is saved and it becomes the latest stored data in the database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/media/f0f34a61efc0550490f3adf85b7929ef/href&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/media/f0f34a61efc0550490f3adf85b7929ef/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that failure to retrieve the data or save it to the database, raises an exception. When this happens within a worker, this will cause the worker to be put into the retry queue for it to be run again later. In this way short term API and or data errors can be handled without adding additional code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Calculator&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the system now able to return an up-to-date array of bank holiday dates, it was a straightforward task to create a working day calculator using the &lt;em&gt;business&lt;/em&gt; gem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this gem accepts the dates as strings, there was no need to convert them to dates first, which simplifies the code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing all that was required was a way of returning a date a number of days ahead of today. As the &lt;em&gt;business&lt;/em&gt; gem provides a number of working day calculations, it will be fairly simple to extend the functionality as required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/media/38d26e72793a67b616b95a529d816b5a/href&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/media/38d26e72793a67b616b95a529d816b5a/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The end result&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these changes in place, within the app the date ten working days from now can be returned with the call :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WorkingDayCalculator.working_days_from_now(10)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making that call will trigger a worker that will check that the data is up-to-date for the next call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complete set of code with specs, within the context it was used can be seen in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ministryofjustice/laa-apply-for-legal-aid/pull/593&quot;&gt;Pull Request&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoyed this article, please feel free to hit the👏 clap button and leave a response below.

			&lt;p&gt;GOV.UK is home to guidance, news and information from all government departments. We have over 400,000 unique pieces of content, and to give our users the best experience, we need to get them to the most useful content as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way of doing this is by adding links to the ‘related content’ section on the right-hand side of each page, so that users can easily navigate to similar pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-6958 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/image4-e1560961786520-620x380.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image showing the UK bank holiday page on GOV.UK, with a right side panel showing two related content links, namely “Holiday entitlement” and “School term and holiday dates”&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;380&quot; srcset=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/image4-e1560961786520-620x380.png 620w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/image4-e1560961786520-310x190.png 310w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/image4-e1560961786520-768x470.png 768w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/image4-e1560961786520-435x266.png 435w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/image4-e1560961786520.png 1999w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creating related links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, related links were hand-curated by content publishers with expert domain knowledge. Around 2,000 pages on GOV.UK have these links and to extend this feature to all pages would take a long time. This is where data science can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of methods have been documented to have worked well in industry for this task; we needed to test these on our specific use case. We used machine learning algorithms based on our previous work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2019/05/23/detecting-semantic-similarity-on-gov-uk/&quot;&gt;semantic similarity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2019/05/29/connecting-the-dots-network-science-on-gov-uk/&quot;&gt;network science&lt;/a&gt; (log likelihood ratio and Node2Vec) to generate these links automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What would success look like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method&quot;&gt;scientific method&lt;/a&gt; to empirically evaluate any changes we make to the site. We formulate hypotheses and test their falsehood using evidence. We organised workshop sessions with a diverse team of &lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.uk&quot;&gt;GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt; experts to decide on testable hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-6955 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/Data-1-620x413.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image showing three people in a workshop, with post-its on the window.&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;413&quot; srcset=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/Data-1-620x413.png 620w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/Data-1-310x207.png 310w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/Data-1-768x512.png 768w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/Data-1-435x290.png 435w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We explored the data available to us to see what we could measure during the test. We presented the options back to our team, explaining how they would be calculated and their feasibility. As a team, we discussed which metrics were expected to change if the newly-generated links were any good. We narrowed it down to a handful of metrics that could be framed as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ucl.ac.uk/child-health/short-courses-events/about-statistical-courses/research-methods-and-statistics/chapter-6-content-4&quot;&gt;null hypotheses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A/B testing our hypotheses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the null hypotheses we tested were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no significant difference in the proportion of journeys using at least one related link. If this is true, then people aren’t clicking our links, probably because they don’t find them useful or interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no significant difference in the proportion of journeys that use internal search. If this is true, then we didn’t provide people with relevant links to click on so they still use internal search to navigate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test these, we ran a randomised experiment and assigned users via a digital coin toss to one of 2 possible versions of the site with equal probability: half the users were directed to the control site (A) and the other half to the site with the algorithmically generated related links (B). This is known as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing&quot;&gt;A/B test&lt;/a&gt; and is a popular way of testing changes to digital products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_6959&quot; style=&quot;width: 630px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-6959&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6959 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/image3-620x434.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image showing the A and B variant versions of the “Paternity pay and leave” page on GOV.UK. The A variant on the left is the control page without any related links, and the B variant on the right has 5 related content items that were generated by algorithms&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;434&quot; srcset=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/image3-620x434.png 620w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/image3-310x217.png 310w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/image3-768x537.png 768w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/image3-435x304.png 435w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/image3.png 1662w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-6959&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;An example of an A and B variant page, on the left and right, respectively&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to bring our false negative rate down below 20%, so we estimated a good sample size for each experiment; each algorithm’s related links would need to be live for about a week. This meant that we had a very short window between analysing the results, iterating algorithms to make improvements and generating the new and improved related links. So to speed up our approach we wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/govuk_ab_analysis&quot;&gt;code as a software package on Github&lt;/a&gt; that enabled us to run the analysis instantly upon experiment completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This initial early investment into automation reduced the risk of human error and freed up our time to implement other algorithms. Any of our data scientists could run the analysis and get consistent results to present back to the team, and each experiment was analysed in exactly the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Statistical significance vs practical significance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excitingly, both of our null hypotheses were shown to be false, meaning that something very interesting was happening on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first hypothesis being false implies that users found the related links interesting and/or relevant so they clicked them. For our best-scoring algorithms, users were clicking our related links for over 2.4% of their journeys – that’s improved journeys for more than 10,000 users per day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more interestingly, our second hypothesis being false means that users don’t appear as lost on the site as they don’t use internal search as much. The results show that there’s a potential reduction in internal search by about 20 to 40% depending on the algorithm used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-6956 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/rap_blog_ab-620x372.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure showing the reduction in journeys using internal search for the 3 algorithms tested. Results are: 20% for content similarity, 25% for node2vec and 35% for log likelihood ratio. All scores have error bars of about ±5%&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;372&quot; srcset=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/rap_blog_ab-620x372.png 620w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/rap_blog_ab-310x186.png 310w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/rap_blog_ab-768x461.png 768w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/rap_blog_ab-435x261.png 435w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/rap_blog_ab.png 1500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These scores were not the only considerations for selecting our winning algorithm to deploy – we also considered the economic, social, political and technological ramifications of each approach. Out of the 2 top-scoring algorithms, we decided to implement Node2Vec as it has more potential for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we decided that we would not replace the hand-curated links in those 2,000 pages that had them, as despite how good our algorithms are at the moment, they still do not have the same context as a subject matter expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to this work, the vast majority of GOV.UK pages did not have curated recommended links. We automated that process, improving thousands of user journeys per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are very excited to put our algorithmically-generated related links in production within the GOV.UK infrastructure and we’ll tell you how this went soon!&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/07/20/building-capability-and-community-through-the-government-data-science-partnership/&quot;&gt;Government Data Science Partnership&lt;/a&gt; (GDSP) brings together public servants to share knowledge about data science. It’s a collaboration between the Government Digital Service (GDS), Office for National Statistics (ONS) and the Government Office for Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At our latest meet-up about 60 people, from more than 20 departments and public bodies, gathered in Manchester to discuss Natural Language Processing (NLP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NLP is used to interpret unstructured text data, such as free-text notes or survey feedback. It can help us look for similarities and uncover patterns in what people have written, which is a difficult task because of nuances in sentence structure and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_6928&quot; style=&quot;width: 630px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-6928&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6928 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/20190613_part-of-speech-620x243.png&quot; alt=&quot;The sentence &#39;the cat sat on the map&#39; with parts of speech tagging highlighted - the (article) cat (noun) sat (verb) on (preposition) the (article) mat (noun)&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;243&quot; srcset=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/20190613_part-of-speech-620x243.png 620w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/20190613_part-of-speech-310x121.png 310w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/20190613_part-of-speech-768x300.png 768w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/20190613_part-of-speech-435x170.png 435w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-6928&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Labelling a sentence with parts of speech, such as nouns (‘cat’ and ‘mat’) and verbs (‘sat’), to help understand syntax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve written before about NLP for &lt;a href=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2016/12/20/using-machine-learning-to-classify-user-comments-on-gov-uk/&quot;&gt;classifying user feedback&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2017/01/12/using-data-science-to-build-a-taxonomy-for-gov-uk/&quot;&gt;tagging pages of GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt;, and the Ministry of Justice have used it to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/2017/12/20/using-textual-analysis-to-build-better-services/&quot;&gt;identify document relationships&lt;/a&gt;. At the meet-up we heard from data scientists across the public sector on how NLP is being used in their organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Finding patterns&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers can do a better job than humans at identifying patterns in text datasets. On the day, 2 data scientists spoke about their use of unsupervised machine learning to help them. This is when a computer is used to find patterns in the data without any prior information about what it should be looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Schofield from NHS Digital was tasked with identifying meaningful groupings from the free-text input of a nationwide dataset of appointments in GP practices. He used Python to convert his documents to numbers with &lt;a href=&quot;https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/doc2vec.html&quot;&gt;Doc2Vec&lt;/a&gt; and simplified their complexity using &lt;a href=&quot;https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/&quot;&gt;an approach called t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbourhood Embedding)&lt;/a&gt;. Dan fed this information into an &lt;a href=&quot;https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html&quot;&gt;algorithm called HDBSCAN&lt;/a&gt; to find meaningful groups, including one that contained appointments related to injections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke Stanbra from the Department for Work and Pensions presented on using free-text data to group incident support tickets and find common root causes. Like Dan, Luke used an unsupervised approach called topic modelling to solve this problem. He discussed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation&quot;&gt;Latent Dirichlet Allocation&lt;/a&gt; (LDA) to assign texts to abstract ‘topics’ that represent word distributions and how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.structuraltopicmodel.com/&quot;&gt;structural topic models&lt;/a&gt; can improve models by taking into account document-level data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Creating pipelines&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as unsupervised machine learning, supervised techniques are also used for NLP. This is when an algorithm predicts a label for new data based on some data that’s already been labelled by humans with specialist knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Stanbury, Neil Potter and their team at HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) used both supervised and unsupervised techniques in a pipeline to help classify and present thousands of feedback items that are received each day by the department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HMRC staff tagged a sample of comments, and the team used this to train a supervised classification model, making use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine&quot;&gt;Support Vector Machines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-gradient-boosting-machines-9be756fe76ab&quot;&gt;Gradient Boosting Machines&lt;/a&gt;. The model tagged incoming data when its confidence in a label was high enough. Unlabelled comments were passed into an unsupervised LDA topic model to identify emerging topics that could become new tags, ensuring data wasn’t wasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_6930&quot; style=&quot;width: 630px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-6930&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6930 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/20190508_hmrc-workflow-620x489.png&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram showing the flow of comments in the HMRC system. New comments flow into the supervised model, unclassified comments are clustered in an unsupervised model before being sent back to HMRC staff&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;489&quot; srcset=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/20190508_hmrc-workflow-620x489.png 620w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/20190508_hmrc-workflow-310x244.png 310w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/20190508_hmrc-workflow-768x606.png 768w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/06/20190508_hmrc-workflow-435x343.png 435w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-6930&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A supervised model classifies new comments after training on manually tagged ones. Any leftover unclassified comments are grouped for review by an unsupervised model&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summarising text&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NLP is not always about grouping and labelling data based on free-text content. Data science approaches can also be used to help summarise documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be a tricky and time-consuming job for a human, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/author/chaitanya-joshi/&quot;&gt;Chaitanya Joshi&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;ONS Data Science Campus&lt;/a&gt; has explored ways to speed up and automate this process with a method called extractive text summarisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his investigations, he used an unsupervised machine learning method called &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06726&quot;&gt;skip-thoughts&lt;/a&gt; to cluster similar sentences and select the most representative ones for each cluster. The method is based on a word-level skip-gram approach but extended to sentences. It results in a small number of sentences that best represent the whole document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Peer surgery&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hearing the talks, attendees split into groups to ask questions and get solutions from the community about how to prepare data for NLP and use machine learning to make sense of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One topic discussed was a fundamental problem with text data: misspellings. For example, ‘Monday’ and ‘Mondya’ will not be recorded as the same word. Suggested solutions included the use of dictionary lookups and word-clustering algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another group discussed &lt;a href=&quot;https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/o-p-t-i-m-u-s-turning-free-text-lists-into-hierarchical-datasets/&quot;&gt;an open source tool from the Data Science Campus called Optimus&lt;/a&gt;. Optimus takes short text records and helps to group and label them automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session closed with participants feeding back on what they’d learnt from the discussions and how they can go back to their organisations with this knowledge in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Get involved&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;noquotes&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public servants can continue the NLP conversation in &lt;a href=&quot;https://govdatascience.slack.com/messages/C0NF51LE4/&quot;&gt;the #nlp channel&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://govdatascience.slack.com/&quot;&gt;cross-government data science Slack&lt;/a&gt;. You can also register your interest for upcoming text analytics meet-ups by &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:textanalyticscoi@homeoffice.gov.uk&quot;&gt;emailing the organisers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GDSP meet-ups are open to anyone in government with an interest in data science techniques. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=fe5d4a0d2b6e6ba6201b54e01&amp;amp;id=d7630ed182&quot;&gt;Sign up for the mailing list &lt;/a&gt;or join &lt;a href=&quot;https://govdatascience.slack.com/messages/C1LJKK292/&quot;&gt;the #community_of_interest channel&lt;/a&gt; on Slack.

			&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jabley&quot;&gt;James Abley&lt;/a&gt; (Technical Architecture Profession)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Xkyr-y0AgzwgqzJIZ2LKDA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Context&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of parts of government, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice&quot;&gt;Ministry of Justice&lt;/a&gt; has a large technology estate. Ours includes many things which pre-date &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/digital-and-technology-spend-controls-version-5&quot;&gt;GDS spend controls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/g-cloud-buyers-guide&quot;&gt;How government bought things&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;changed over the last 6 years&lt;/a&gt;. But we still have things from before that time. In this article, I’m &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.usejournal.com/toxic-technology-the-growing-legacy-threat-b95ad098a339&quot;&gt;calling those things legacy services&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these legacy services are business-critical core systems without which we could not operate. It would cause massive amounts of pain/frustration if they weren’t available. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/daverog&quot;&gt;CTO Dave Rogers&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@daverog/deep-transformation-a745167befcf&quot;&gt;written about some of the problems faced when trying to transform these ageing services&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delivering substantive changes to services can take time. But just because something is hard doesn’t mean it’s not worth doing. And if you do it right, you can end up in a much better place, making continuous small improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Our problems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the properties of these systems are less than desirable. For example, changes are very infrequent. We have services that are only updated once per year. These changes are risky affairs. Downtime with weekend work is the norm. Then there is usually the unofficially accepted post-release cleanup period. This involves further unplanned releases to address problems introduced by the planned release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infrequent releases are not great for the people using the system who may be experiencing frustration. Batching up fixes in this way means we are delaying improving people’s quality of life. That’s quite a blunt way of putting it; it’s meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the cost of change is too large. Changing the services involved the work of many people over a long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339&quot;&gt;The book Accelerate&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nicolefv&quot;&gt;Dr Nicole Forsgren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jezhumble&quot;&gt;Jez Humble&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realgenekim&quot;&gt;Gene Kim&lt;/a&gt; contains a wealth of evidence (science FTW!) about high-performing technology organisations. It talks about 4 key metrics that are useful to measure when trying to understand Software Delivery Performance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead time&lt;/strong&gt; — the time it takes from a customer making a request to the request being fulfilled&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deployment Frequency&lt;/strong&gt; — this is a proxy for batch size, which is easier to measure and typically has low variability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)&lt;/strong&gt; — when a service incident occurs, how quickly is service restored?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change Fail Percentage&lt;/strong&gt; — what percentage of changes to production fail?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we’re doing one release a year, we can see that the average lead time is 6 months. Deployment frequency is annual. The mean time to restore was a week, but sometimes fixes were expedited and done mid-week rather than waiting for another weekend to do a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the Change Fail Percentage was very high. Maybe not quite 100%, but not far off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Our journey&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recently migrated all the services for the Legal Aid Agency from traditional hosting. A business case had established that moving some of the services to the public cloud would give us financial benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we also managed to eke out some other benefits as part of the migration. We have made huge improvements to the metrics mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had some guiding principles for the migration to public cloud:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will move out of the current data centre&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will not provide the service in a way that is any worse than the current service&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Applications delivered into public cloud will have a stable, automated deployment pipeline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Applications in public cloud should capable of redeployment during normal working hours&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These were enough to get the organisation (and our users!) to a much better place:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have got the lead time to the same day, for small changes/fixes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The deployment frequency averaged around every 3 days* (previously it was once a year).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mean Time To Restore is currently untested, but the lead time and deployment frequency numbers show that it would be resolved on the same day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Change Fail Percentage has dropped to 0%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How we did this&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Deployment pipeline&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deployment pipeline is an automated manifestation of your process for getting changes into an environment. Adopting a deployment pipeline means that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jabley/status/1005045771593494528&quot;&gt;all changes have to go through version-control&lt;/a&gt;. A change happens in version-control and that starts a build. This enhancement to the system in how people worked ensured visibility of changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The application/service gets built once and then deployed everywhere with the relevant configuration for that environment. This gave a nice separation between things that tend to have different rates of change — the application code, and the configuration for each environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Trunk-based development&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com&quot;&gt;Trunk-based development&lt;/a&gt; has helped:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ensure small batch sizes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;increase the frequency of deployments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;reduce the risk of deployments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;reduce the time spent merging long-lived branches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we can try to break down work so that useful increments can be delivered regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stabilisation periods are no longer necessary. Time spent doing difficult merges of long-lived branches that have diverged a long way from the main trunk branch is no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Adding automated tests&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the legacy services were created when Test-Driven Development and other practices were not as widespread. They do not have a vast suite of automated tests with a high level of coverage which give us the confidence to know we aren’t breaking things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most valuable investment we decided we could make was adding functional tests which exercised the way our users would typically use the applications. If we could replicate the happy path of how people used the system, we could manage the risk that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The migration would not break anything&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We could continue to improve and fix things post-migration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These sorts of tests are slower to execute, since they typically need a few distributed components, but they gave us the best level of coverage when working with code bases that had not been designed to be testable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the deployment pipeline, these tests are a quality gate that runs for every potential change which might go in front of our users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eliminating waste&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Software-Development-Agile-Toolkit/dp/0321150783&quot;&gt;a Lean sense&lt;/a&gt;, we have also &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development#Eliminate_waste&quot;&gt;eliminated various wasteful activities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we had long-lived branches, we used to have a different environment per-branch. People had to track which version was in which environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we’re doing trunk-based development with the ability to deploy to production on the same day, we don’t need to do that. If someone asks what version is in environment X, we always know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The deployment pipeline keeps track of it now, rather than a person, so check what the deployment pipeline says is deployed in environment X&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But mostly the answer will be “trunk”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have also got rid of several environments; we no longer need to pay for them, or manage them, due to our new ways of working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We started the migration wanting to realise the cost-savings available to us from using public cloud. In truth, we know we are still very early on in the journey for this part of the organisation. And it’s not evenly distributed. Some of our colleagues have to work with bits that are still harder than they should be to change and improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we have achieved lots of small improvements. Small batch sizes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;reduce risk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;give opportunity for faster feedback and learning opportunities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;are faster to deliver value to the organisation and our users&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is such a massive difference for the organisation, and something we should be immensely proud of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*It was quite high for a while because, for the first time, we had better insight about how the systems were running in production. We could access the logs and see the graphs. We could see the unreported frustrations that our users were tolerating or working around every day. So we fixed them. For most of the teams now, it’s a capability that they can choose to exercise as part of their normal sprint cadence (typically fortnightly).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoyed this article, please feel free to hit the👏 clap button and leave a response below.

This is an issue; delays are created, the release process is made more complex and the involvement of other teams are required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Testing database deployment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We considered &lt;a href=&quot;https://flywaydb.org/&quot;&gt;Flyway by Boxfuse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liquibase.org/&quot;&gt;Liquibase by Datical.&lt;/a&gt; We decided on Liquibase and have been generally pleased with the approach it takes and how it fits in to our workflow. Flyway looked promising but would have cost $3,000 to support our version of Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Testing PL/SQL&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With regards to PL/SQL we have set up a proof of concept to see a couple of possible solutions in action. Initially, we considered these tools:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oracle’s SQL Developer’s built in unit testing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Code Tester by Quest (Toad)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;utPLSQL, a framework that’s been around for a few years which was originally developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stevenfeuerstein.com/&quot;&gt;Steve Feuerstein&lt;/a&gt; himself, and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ruby-plsql-spec, a unit testing framework which is built using Ruby, ruby-plsql (library) and Rspec.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;… and decided on &lt;a href=&quot;http://utplsql.org/&quot;&gt;utPLSQL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rsim/ruby-plsql-spec&quot;&gt;ruby-plsql-spec&lt;/a&gt;. The former because it was more well-established and the latter because of the growing Ruby competency among our teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Ruby way&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion is ruby-plsql-spec works great! See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQAed94rI3vk6Sc8zd2h1-nqGBZyhroO38OlgNJBPJit4pUOzbPRwXRypdup3eq-0KzwokTdXH2R79X/pub?start=false&amp;amp;loop=false&amp;amp;delayms=3000&amp;amp;slide=id.p&quot;&gt;Unit Testing PL/SQL Procedures From Ruby Code&lt;/a&gt; for a more in-depth look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*i9h13kQzmlYSaJFs1PjleQ.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;See slides here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQAed94rI3vk6Sc8zd2h1-nqGBZyhroO38OlgNJBPJit4pUOzbPRwXRypdup3eq-0KzwokTdXH2R79X/pub?start=false&amp;amp;loop=false&amp;amp;delayms=3000&amp;amp;slide=id.p&quot;&gt;Unit Testing PL/SQL Procedures From Ruby Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The utPLSQL way&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We deployed utPLSQL onto a development database. Unfortunately we can’t run the database locally at the moment 😞 so we share a single development database hosted in Amazon — there’s a separate piece of work going on to resolve this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial challenges surrounded taking the automated install apart and doing it manually — this is because AWS RDS does not allow file-system access and it was something we could get on with straight away rather than getting the install scripts to run remotely from the DB in question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with utPLSQL is very much a manual process; there is no automation — you will have to write all the test code and you will have to maintain it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is some output generated utPLSQL tests run on the HUB development environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Between string function&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Returns substring from start position to end position [.129 sec] (FAILED - 1)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Returns substring when start position is zero [.002 sec] (FAILED - 2)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Failures:&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1) basic_usage&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Actual: &amp;#39;234&amp;#39; (varchar2) was expected to equal: &amp;#39;2345&amp;#39; (varchar2 at &amp;quot;HUB.TEST_BETWNSTR&amp;quot;, line 5 ut.expect(betwnstr(&amp;#39;1234567&amp;#39;, 2, 5)).to_equal(&amp;#39;2345&amp;#39;);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;2) zero_start_position&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Actual: &amp;#39;1234&amp;#39; (varchar2) was expected to equal: &amp;#39;12345&amp;#39; (varchar2 at &amp;quot;HUB.TEST_BETWNSTR&amp;quot;, line 10 ut.expect(betwnstr( &amp;#39;1234567&amp;#39;, 0, 5 ) ).to_equal(&amp;#39;12345&amp;#39;);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Finished in .131936 seconds&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;2 tests, 2 failed, 0 errored, 0 disabled, 0 warning(s)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Next steps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have got both these frameworks working, we need to start incorporating them into actual work so that we can better understand how best to benefit from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few points we will be looking to address as we go forwards:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Testing across multiple databases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Standing up and tearing down databases as part of the automated testing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Transaction testing e.g. table data, rollbacks to savepoints etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complex type testing e.g. associative arrays of nested objects&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integration with the code pipeline and Flyway DB.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exception handling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TDD going forwards with regards to the existing code-base.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoyed this article, please feel free to hit the👏 clap button and leave a response below.

			&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/@JoelGSamuel&quot;&gt;Joel Samuel&lt;/a&gt; (Cyber Security Consultant Team)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MoJ’s Cyber Security team is led by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JonPLawrence&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jonathan Lawrence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Chief Information Security Officer, and is responsible for helping the whole department manage cyber security risks through expert advice/ guidance, incident management/ response and proactive ‘offensive’ penetration testing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dW9pMZ7kw0Qa8gU7PiS2kg.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Measuring security is hard&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relatively simple concept of being sure you have the right security in place to keep systems (and the data within) safe (also known as ‘information assurance’) is easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are various methodologies for determining risk, measuring controls, value of controls (and so on) and each require a varying level of expertise by the assessor in order to complete them. One size definitely does not fit all when the team is responsible for cyber security in systems ranging from internal IT tools/solutions (laptops, WiFi, Google G-Suite, Microsoft Office 365, Trello, Slack and so on) to case management solutions used for administering over £1 billion a year in legal aid, as well as brand new digital services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;External standards&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are various external standards that a UK central government organisation is expected to adhere to. One of the key ones for cyber security is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-minimum-cyber-security-standard&quot;&gt;Minimum Cyber Security Standard&lt;/a&gt; (MCSS) that was developed by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/cabinet-office&quot;&gt;Cabinet Office&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;National Cyber Security Centre&lt;/a&gt; (NCSC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posed the problem of how in an imperfect cyber security or ‘information assurance’ world does the team measure a diverse range of technology solutions against the MCSS while also making the assessment method simple to use, repeatable, standardised and in a format that would allow us to compare different systems using the same measurements to identify trends horizontally… a tall ask!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Design with data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3rd &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles&quot;&gt;government design principle&lt;/a&gt; is “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#design-with-data&quot;&gt;design with data&lt;/a&gt;” and, while this is a different kind of ‘design’, I thought this principle matched the challenge really well so I decided to ensure any method created &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; that could be dynamically turn into &lt;em&gt;information&lt;/em&gt;. Free-text is hard to read, analyse and update and is subject to variations in terminology and intention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/warmana&quot;&gt;Adrian&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/just-tech/data-or-information-is-there-a-difference-and-does-it-matter-355bb9f4a408&quot;&gt;posted about this before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Et voila! Welcome to Standards Assurance Tables&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used a bit of math (often quite basic!), &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093340?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=9199554&quot;&gt;IMPORTRANGE()&lt;/a&gt; and a smidge of Google Script to create a template Google Sheet spreadsheet and dubbed it the &lt;strong&gt;Standards Assurance Table&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MOJ believes ‘security’ can work in the open so in addition to publishing it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ministryofjustice/itpolicycontent/&quot;&gt;IT policies&lt;/a&gt;, as part of an open-sourced &lt;a href=&quot;https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/&quot;&gt;cyber security guidance microsite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;the MOJ have published &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/guides/standards-assurance-tables/#standards-assurance-tables&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;how the Standard Assurance Tables work and the theory behind them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some information risk management concepts were maintained such as maintaining the use of ‘evidence’ (documentation, drawings and so on — not hearsay) and ‘confidence’ (how well the assessor thinks the evidence demonstrates the target system is meeting the standard) but ultimately ignored existing information risk methodologies for the purposes of this work, to create a clean, simple slate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A horizontal view&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time an aggregator Google Sheet was created for collated analysis. The aggregator uses even more IMPORTRANGE() to pull all completed Standards Assurance Tables together for horizontal analysis and this works really well given data was kept as data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of this work the MOJ has already identified trends (across entirely diverse systems that have never before been compared) and this has directly led how the team are investing time and money to get the most amount of proportional security benefit while responsibly managing public funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Designed for scale&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The table wasn’t named the “MCSS Table” because while this work began due to a particular standard I wanted to ensure any method can scale and adapt over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team are now working with information governance colleagues across the MOJ to expand the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/guides/standards-assurance-tables/#objectives&quot;&gt;objectives&lt;/a&gt; beyond the MCSS and build some really powerful data-driven governance and investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Onwards&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/guides/standards-assurance-tables/#standards-assurance-tables&quot;&gt;Standards Assurance Tables&lt;/a&gt; nor the aggregating Google Sheet analyse or represent change over time to keep the initial scope reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/media/79ec4344dd81ea761f65b1190f1ac36b/href&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/media/79ec4344dd81ea761f65b1190f1ac36b/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each table already has an active Google Script that records changes as they are made. One of the things the team want to do next is leverage this metadata to help measure how systems fair over time, individually and in aggregate — which I think will be quite nifty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoyed this article, please feel free to hit the👏 clap button and leave a response below.

			&lt;p&gt;by Mat Moore (Software Development Profession)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GOV.UK Service Manual encourages us to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/making-source-code-open-and-reusable&quot;&gt;make source code open source&lt;/a&gt;. This is a great policy because it &lt;a href=&quot;https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/21/why-we-code-in-the-open/&quot;&gt;holds us to account and allows code to be reused by other teams&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also common for software-as-a-service solutions that work with GitHub to charge extra for private repositories, so open source makes it cheaper and easier for us to deliver software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you make your code open from the start of the project, it’s easy to do it securely. But what about making existing source code open? &lt;a href=&quot;https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2018/02/19/how-to-open-up-closed-code/&quot;&gt;How to open up closed code&lt;/a&gt; by Anna Shipman explores 3 approaches for managing this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cycle all the credentials&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rewrite the git history to remove sensitive information&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Move the code to a new repository bit by bit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When my team decided to make one of our private repositories public, we decided to go with option 2 — Rewrite the git history to remove sensitive information — because it would be easier for us than rotating credentials. It turned out this was not enough to avoid disclosing credentials because of the way GitHub references diffs in pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/en/articles/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository&quot;&gt;GitHub’s own advice&lt;/a&gt; states that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Once you have pushed a commit to GitHub, you should consider any data it contains to be compromised.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What went wrong&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the project was originally created, we’d mostly avoided committing credentials to the repository. Instead, we used AWS Parameter Store to manage configuration and credentials for each environment — these get passed into the application as environment variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the repository did contain one credential. We depend on a shared development database, and we’d committed a password for this in the docker-compose.yml file, which is used to run the application locally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this we ran &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/en/articles/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository&quot;&gt;git filter-branch&lt;/a&gt; to completely remove the file from the git history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then recreated our docker compose configuration using a separate docker-compose.override.yml file, which is encrypted with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt&quot;&gt;git-crypt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the first pull request for this didn’t set up git-crypt correctly, and when reviewing it, I added a comment to point this out. What I didn’t realise is that this comment would persist even after the commit had been rebased and the branch deleted. Whenever code is commented on, GitHub retains the diff and just adds an “outdated” badge if the code is no longer in the repository.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-YsYhUByLbGRPRjhPn0SaA.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ultimately caused us to leak the credential when we made the repository public. Luckily, we noticed this shortly after and changed the credential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to avoid this&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many automated tools for detecting secrets focus on the git repository itself, rather than the project page on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that any comment ever made in a code review could potentially expose secrets. In our case the repository was fairly new, so we could have manually audited GitHub issues and pull requests to check for anything sensitive, but this might not always be feasible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could avoid this problem by choosing either of the other two approaches Anna describes in her blog post:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;cycling all the credentials&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;starting a new repository entirely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could also combine rewriting history with moving to a fresh repository.

&lt;h2&gt;GOV.UK can be represented as a multilayer network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOV.UK is a group of pages that comprises the best place to find government services and information. In its most abstract form, GOV.UK can be represented as a network made of pages, represented as nodes, that are connected to each other using links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The links indicate a relationship between the pages, and the way we define them can give us different insights about our content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, we have three ways we can connect pages: via the hardcoded links found in the text, by users clicking from one page to visit another and, finally, by their &lt;a href=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2019/05/23/detecting-semantic-similarity-on-gov-uk/&quot;&gt;semantic similarity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Publishers define the structural network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When publishers create a new piece of content they include links to other related pages. Then certain navigational links that facilitate browsing, like breadcrumbs and other items from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2018/10/19/how-we-used-deep-learning-to-structure-gov-uks-content/&quot;&gt;relevant topic in the taxonomy&lt;/a&gt;, are automatically linked to the new content item. In this way, the structural network of GOV.UK is created, consisting of approximately 250,000 nodes and 350,000 links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first started using network science methods on the site, our aim was to assess its structural integrity and connectivity. We wanted to know whether all content areas of the site are accessible and linked to – which turns out they are, but a few are more remote than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to identify the pages that are much more connected than others – what we now call hubs. To investigate these, we calculated network properties, including network density, connectedness, link distribution and centrality measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network analysis has also proven useful in evaluating individual pages. While there are a few ways to describe the format and aboutness of a page, it’s more difficult to determine its position and significance within the overall network. For critical content, we have ranked pages by the number of different functional connections they facilitate, their node neighbourhoods and the subnetworks and communities they belong to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Users create the functional network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functional network of GOV.UK is induced by users clicking from one page to visit another, using any of the available links or by using internal search. We create single user journeys by chaining together user page hits within a session and then we accumulate these to create the functional network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_6903&quot; style=&quot;width: 630px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-6903&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-6903 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/05/networkpath-620x521.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image showing an example of a functional network path, represented as a series of GOV.UK pages clicked in order by a user traversing along hyperlinks.&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;521&quot; srcset=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/05/networkpath-620x521.jpg 620w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/05/networkpath-310x261.jpg 310w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/05/networkpath-768x646.jpg 768w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/05/networkpath-435x366.jpg 435w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/05/networkpath.jpg 1782w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-6903&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Figure showing the functional network path created from a user traversing along hyperlinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did a bit of data engineering and created a Python tool (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-network-data&quot;&gt;GOV.UK Network Data Pipeline&lt;/a&gt;) to automatically extract user journeys from BigQuery – the database that stores our Google Analytics data. These were then aggregated over a specific time period to produce the resulting functional network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our main motivation for using this functional network is to learn from how users interact with the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Understanding how users navigate the site&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things we learned is that despite there being a lot of content on GOV.UK, it turns out users tend to visit a relatively small part of the site. Around 2% of pages are visited at least once in 87% of user journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, visits to service pages are very frequent and important. Over a third of journeys contain a service page, and their resulting subnetworks are very densely connected. For example, there are about 250 different links that lead to the&lt;i&gt; ‘&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/sign-in-universal-credit&quot;&gt;Sign in to your Universal Credit account&lt;/a&gt;’ page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on an average day, between 10 and 15% of the traffic on the site is unique. That means that we have about 1 million unique user journeys, indicating that users go about finding their information in differing ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improving findability using multilayer temporal networks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to improve the user experience by helping users find the information they seek in fewer steps. So we compared the functional network to the underlying structural network, and used this to inform structural changes that would improve navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, where the users were not taking the structural shortest paths, we introduced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/10/17/building-a-better-gov-uk-step-by-step/&quot;&gt;step by step&lt;/a&gt; process, enforcing a sequence of pages that would be visited in order. And where it wasn’t necessary for users to get information from multiple pages, we added shortcuts to what we thought were their destination pages. Keep your eyes peeled for future blog posts showing how we created these shortcuts and  evaluated them using A/B testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors would like to acknowledge Dr Paul Expert (Imperial College London) for his advice on using network science to improve findability on GOV.UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work will be presented at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/2019netsci&quot;&gt;NetSci 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the flagship conference of the Network Science Society, that aims to bring together leading network science researchers and practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;h2&gt;Representing text as vectors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can represent the text on each GOV.UK page as a semantic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&quot;&gt;vector&lt;/a&gt;. This is denoted by a list of numbers, which conveys information about the page contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/content-similarity-models&quot;&gt;We tried&lt;/a&gt; a few ways to develop these semantic vectors, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/doc2vec.html&quot;&gt;Gensim’s Doc2vec&lt;/a&gt;, fine-tuning the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google-research/bert&quot;&gt;BERT pre-trained base model&lt;/a&gt; and Google’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/2&quot;&gt;universal sentence encoder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter uses a deep averaging network (DAN) encoder trained on text from a variety of sources. It &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11175.pdf&quot;&gt;outperforms&lt;/a&gt; Doc2vec in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/stswiki/index.php/STSbenchmark&quot;&gt;STS benchmark&lt;/a&gt; and was quick to implement, so we selected it for use in solving GOV.UK problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-6871 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/05/19-05-22-Nicky-Zachariou-data-blog-post-9915-620x413.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Two post-its showing cosine distance for similar pages (small angle) and non-similar pages (wide angle)&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;413&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each semantic vector represents a content item and the cosine of the angle between the vectors is called ‘the cosine distance’. The smaller the angle, the more similar the items are, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Measuring vector similarity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The position of semantic vectors in the vector space tells us about their meaning. Neighbouring vectors represent pages that are similar to each other, and distant ones denote pages that are different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can measure how similar 2 items of content are to each other by using the angle created by their respective vectors. The similarity score is called ‘the cosine distance’, and is calculated by taking the cosine of the angle between the two vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, content items which are more similar will have a smaller angle between them and thus a larger similarity score, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Identifying duplicate content with vector similarity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last 6 months, 700 content items have been published on GOV.UK per week. This high publishing rate can result in multiple content items being published to serve the same user need. This is unnecessary and confusing for users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semantic similarity can identify duplicate content, and can inform publishers where their content overlaps with pre-existing content. This can be done at the publication stage – to prevent duplicate content arising – as well as retrospectively – to clean up existing duplicate content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Informing decisions about the topic taxonomy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important characteristic for our content is the taxon is organised in the topic taxonomy. The taxonomy is currently structured like a tree with each topic representing the aboutness of the content tagged to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still iterating both the structure and tagging approach for the topic taxonomy, and there are various ways that the semantic vectors can be used to inform decisions about changing the taxonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can identify problem branches in the topic taxonomy by calculating the average cosine distance across all pairs of content in a taxon, and use this as a metric for taxon diversity. Knowing how diverse the content is helps us to diagnose taxons which are too broad and identify possible clusters of content (for example, using &lt;a href=&quot;https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html&quot;&gt;DBSCAN&lt;/a&gt;) that warrant their own taxon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-6874 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/05/similarity-tsne-620x482.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An X-Y scatter graph where the dots represent different pages. Two clusters (similar content) are highlighted - department spends over £25k and gender pay gap&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;482&quot; srcset=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/05/similarity-tsne-620x482.jpg 620w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/05/similarity-tsne-310x241.jpg 310w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/05/similarity-tsne-768x597.jpg 768w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2019/05/similarity-tsne-435x338.jpg 435w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2D &lt;a href=&quot;https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html&quot;&gt;t-SNE representation&lt;/a&gt; of the semantic vectors of all content in the corporate information taxon of the topic taxonomy. Some distinct clusters of content exist that could potentially form new lower-level taxons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Optimising search and navigation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are various ways in which we can improve our site search and navigation, if our content were better organised and tagged with appropriate metadata. One approach we have been exploring is the use of automatically generated related links, displayed on the right-hand side of GOV.UK pages, to help people get to and explore the content they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first experiment to generate these links used the semantic vector representation of content to display the most semantically similar pages to each page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more on this soon!&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;by Will McBrien (Software Development Profession)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using console.log() to debug JavaScript on the front-end can be a pain as the default output is not particularly pretty. As lots of output can look stylistically similar, it can be difficult to spot what you’re looking for, which can make debugging harder than it should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that there are some tricks you can employ to make console.log() much easier to use! Here are some of the ones I have found to be most useful:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add some cool styles:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;console.log() can accept a CSS string as a second argument, which can be used to style output. This can help to catch your eye (well if you use some colourful styles):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;console.log(‘%c &amp;lt; some artful logging &amp;gt;’, ‘color: white; background-color: #31a59f; text-decoration: underline;’);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*IjG54DBJmp4QNSZm&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note the need to add %c before the text else it won’t apply the styles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One especially useful way to use this is as &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; markers for non-css console.log() statements to help make it really obvious as to what you’re printing. For instance, say you’re printing a lot of output from a loop, it’s nice to clearly mark where the log begins and ends using this technique:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/media/c7773b758d32e3ecbff05d3450480ade/href&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/media/c7773b758d32e3ecbff05d3450480ade/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;which outputs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/182/0*_wpjYqV5An-OwhnZ&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you use this technique, I recommend creating a snippet in your editor of choice so that you don’t need to spend time thinking of how you want to style things — this also makes it easier to mix and match your styled console.log() output with the default. In Visual Studio Code you can create language specific snippets by using cmd + shift + p and searching for snippets then selecting the language you want to add a snippet to. My snippet for this looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/media/9d06e365e6ea49baed18969c51e4d553/href&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/media/9d06e365e6ea49baed18969c51e4d553/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can then use it by selecting from the dropdown auto-completion as you type (i.e. &lt;em&gt;slog&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;elog &lt;/em&gt;respectively). Other editors have similar functionality you can use to add these type of snippets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data tables:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you `console.log()` an object it can be annoying to read it’s attributes using the standard log output. You get an output like the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/media/dc251c8c80a3a8341f232d2e068ea77f/href&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/media/dc251c8c80a3a8341f232d2e068ea77f/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/580/0*6zgMMnKBt6VZVKCj&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though this is obviously a really simple example, it is still not that easy to read. Thankfully, there is a useful method that can help with this issue, console.table(), which outputs a nicely formatted tabular representation of a javascript object:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/397/0*UdoCo9Spm5XMTIlm&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is a really clear thing to view in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Groups:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re trying to log things from within a nested data structure or loop construct it can be difficult for your eye to spot the log you’re interested in, for instance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/media/1f7208c3876002f5e209167b8a929f24/href&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/media/1f7208c3876002f5e209167b8a929f24/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which outputs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/94/0*wnCXltCfcN4LcpLq&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here everything appears at the in the same vertical column, making it hard to differentiate output at a glance, as you can’t see nesting particularly clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead why not try employing console.group() and console.groupEnd() as a way to differentiate between different nested levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/media/5390c65c414d827a6d3d28db54253c50/href&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/media/5390c65c414d827a6d3d28db54253c50/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;This separates out your output into nested columns, which can be much easier to read:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/255/0*CXFjC-s8Dx04Vvd9&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously this is another artificially simplified example, but this technique can be useful when outputting complicated nested structures that you would otherwise have to add hacky spaces to the left of console.log() string to get a similar output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another useful approach, use the debugger:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more controlled approach is to use the JavaScript built in debugger, this creates a more familiar context if you’re used to pry in Ruby or other ‘stop execution’ debugging techniques. The debugger keyword opens up the browser’s debugging context at the point at which it is declared in your code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, although this approach is more powerful than console.log() I find that sometimes it is easier to just console.log() output if you want quick feedback without context switching into debugging mode, hence why I think the above techniques are still useful tools to have in you toolbox, despite dedicated debuggers being available :-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoyed this article, please feel free to hit the👏 clap button and leave a response below.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;On GOV.UK we’ve been looking at ways of improving our finder pages, like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/search/services&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/search/news-and-communications&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;news and communications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;. Finder pages allow users to search for specific kinds of content using facets such as topic and organisations to narrow their results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;One of the facets uses a component called an ‘option select’ to display multiple checkboxes in an expandable box. This was built with accessibility in mind – it can be used with a keyboard, the expand/collapse functionality uses a button and the correct &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;ARIA attributes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; are applied automatically. It looks like this:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1596&quot; src=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot with a heading that says &#39;person&#39; and a list of checkboxes that show the following names: Admiral Sir George Zambellas KCB DSC ADC, Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope GCB OBE ADC, Admiral Sir Philip Jones KCB ADC, Air Chief Marshal Sir Andrew Pulford KCB CBE ADC RAF, Alan Charlton CMG CVO&quot; width=&quot;498&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; srcset=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image7.png 498w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image7-310x166.png 310w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image7-435x232.png 435w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Despite this, the component didn’t work well at scale. Some of the facets it was used for included hundreds of options, so navigating to the last checkbox using a keyboard or screen reader was a slow task. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;This presented problems even when using a mouse or a mobile device, as navigating accurately through so many checkboxes became more difficult as the number of options increased.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Worse still, there was no way to search through the checkboxes. Consider how you might try to find a person. Would they be listed alphabetically by their name, or by their title? What if you only knew their surname? Finding them among so many other people could be difficult.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking for an alternative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;A few years ago, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2017/04/20/were-building-an-autocomplete/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;a team at GDS built an accessible autocomplete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;. An autocomplete is a text input that behaves like a select element, but you can also type in it to filter the results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1597&quot; style=&quot;width: 266px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-1597&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-1597&quot; src=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image3.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot that says: Countries, with &#39;France&#39; selected from a dropdown menu&quot; width=&quot;256&quot; height=&quot;101&quot; /&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-1597&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The accessible autocomplete&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;It looked like an ideal replacement for our option selects, as it provided essentially the same functionality but allowed the user to type to filter the available options. This meant that even with a large number of options users would still be able to navigate through them, regardless of how they were using it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Best of all, it had been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2018/05/15/what-we-learned-from-getting-our-autocomplete-tested-for-accessibility/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;built with accessibility in mind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;, so we could have confidence that it would be usable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation and iteration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;We set to work getting the accessible autocomplete into our finders, by creating a new component and adding the autocomplete code into it. After a bit of work, we had it running, and it was a huge improvement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1598&quot; style=&quot;width: 630px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-1598&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1598 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image6-620x458.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot with a search box with &#39;justice&#39; typed into it, showing &#39;Academy for Social Justice&#39; highlighted as a suggestion&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;458&quot; srcset=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image6-620x458.png 620w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image6-310x229.png 310w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image6-768x568.png 768w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image6-435x322.png 435w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image6.png 1086w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-1598&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The accessible autocomplete in place of an option select in the news and communications finder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Although the autocomplete was working well, there was one big problem – it only allowed users to select a single option, whereas the ‘option select’ component that this replaced allowed multiple selections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Fortunately, a version of the accessible autocomplete existed that allowed multiple selections, but when we switched to using it, we discovered another problem. In single selection mode the user’s choice remained in the text box, but in multiple mode the selections were shown beneath it, as there was no room for them in the text box.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1597 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image3.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot that says: Countries, with &#39;France&#39; selected from a dropdown menu&quot; width=&quot;256&quot; height=&quot;101&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1599&quot; style=&quot;width: 360px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-1599&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-1599&quot; src=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image4.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot showing &#39;Countries&#39; as the heading, with a search box underneath and &#39;France, Germany, Sweden&#39; as suggestions underneath that&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;260&quot; srcset=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image4.png 350w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image4-310x230.png 310w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-1599&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The accessible autocomplete operating in single selection mode (top) and multiple selection mode (bottom).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;We refer to the user’s selected options as ‘facet tags’. Clicking a facet tag removes it from the user’s selections. This worked well but we had already added facet tags to our finders for the other facets, so with this change there would be a duplication of functionality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1600&quot; style=&quot;width: 630px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-1600&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-1600&quot; src=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image1-620x326.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of search results, filtered using the organisation filters &#39;Defence Academy of the United Kingdom (DA)&#39; and &#39;Ministry of Defence (MOD)&#39;&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;326&quot; srcset=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image1-620x326.png 620w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image1-310x163.png 310w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image1-768x403.png 768w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image1-435x228.png 435w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image1.png 1078w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-1600&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The accessible autocomplete in a finder in multiple selection mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;If we were to keep the autocomplete’s facet tags, we would have a confusing interface. The best option was to remove them and use our own, but it was not immediately obvious that selecting an option in the autocomplete had been successful, as the result was an empty text box.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;This problem was worse on mobile, where, due to the stacking of the facets above the search results, our facet tags were often not visible at all, so users had no way of knowing that their autocomplete selections had been successful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1601&quot; style=&quot;width: 630px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-1601&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-1601&quot; src=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image2-620x525.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture of a phone showing &#39;News and communications&#39; as a heading and a search box underneath with &#39;minister&#39; typed into it&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;525&quot; srcset=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image2-620x525.png 620w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image2-310x263.png 310w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image2-768x651.png 768w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image2-435x369.png 435w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image2.png 1119w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-1601&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The accessible autocomplete in multiple selection mode on a mobile device, with facet tags hidden to avoid duplication. The user cannot see what they have selected, because it is below the visible area of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;To add to our problems, the accessible autocomplete was intended as an isolated piece of code, meaning that there was no API with which to control it. With the need to be able to remove selections from it without using it directly, we were having to write increasingly complex code in order to manipulate it within our finders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard decisions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;After much consideration and discussion, we reached the difficult conclusion that the accessible autocomplete wasn’t a suitable solution to our problem. It was a hard decision to make – we had already invested considerable time into it and didn’t have a better alternative.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;We returned to the original option select component to consider the problem. Inspired by the autocomplete, we prototyped adding a text input that would allow users to filter the visible options.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1602&quot; src=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image5.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot showing the heading &#39;world location&#39; with a search box with &#39;al&#39; typed into it underneath, and a list of checkboxes saying &#39;Albania, Algeria, American Samoa, Australia&#39; underneath, with &#39;Albania&#39; and &#39;American Samoa&#39; ticked&quot; width=&quot;329&quot; height=&quot;345&quot; srcset=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image5.png 329w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2019/04/image5-310x325.png 310w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Although the filter control looks simple, we had to consider carefully how to make it perform well and be accessible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;User input is sanitised in order to help users match options more easily; it’s case insensitive, it ignores duplicate whitespace, and matches ‘and’ with ‘&amp;amp;’ and vice versa.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Hidden text is included that announces to screen readers how many matches have been found, how many options are selected, and provides context that something is happening as the user enters text.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Checkboxes that have been checked are always shown regardless of the filter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;The option select component still has a few other minor accessibility issues, but the addition of this filter has improved it enormously. We’re still testing and improving it, and you can try it for yourself on our &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/search/news-and-communications&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;news and communications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; finder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;There are a few important things to take away from this experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;If something is inaccessible, this can be a problem for everyone. Finding one checkbox among hundreds isn’t a problem only for people using a screen reader – it can be difficult for all of us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Making something accessible doesn’t necessarily require an entirely new approach. Although the autocomplete looked like the better option, in the end a small change to our original component suited our needs better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;An investment of time and effort into something shouldn’t make it indispensable. Although we’d spent a lot of time integrating the autocomplete into our finders, it wasn’t the best solution to our problem. It can be difficult to discard something, but sometimes it’s the right thing to do. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;And in the end, although we didn’t use it in finders, the autocomplete component was used successfully by another team elsewhere on GOV.UK.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve written a lot recently about how we’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/06/27/building-the-gov-uk-of-the-future/&quot;&gt;building the GOV.UK of the future&lt;/a&gt;. This means making things easier for users through things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/08/23/hey-gov-uk-what-are-you-doing-about-voice/&quot;&gt;considering voice assistants&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/10/17/building-a-better-gov-uk-step-by-step/&quot;&gt;building step by step navigation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/09/28/podcast-head-of-gov-uk-neil-williams-looks-back-on-his-time-at-gds/&quot;&gt;In a recent podcast&lt;/a&gt;, outgoing GOV.UK head Neil Williams talked about these things as evidence the site is ‘iterating wildly’ again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this exciting new work would be possible if we had not first sorted out the fundamentals, like organising all the content on GOV.UK. This was a huge task and doing it manually could have taken years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we - the data scientists at the Government Digital Service - tried to help, by using supervised machine learning to tag all our GOV.UK content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why we used supervised machine learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supervised machine learning is an algorithm that learns patterns from a sample of data that has already been classified, so it can use them to classify new content. We realised we could use it to build on the manual work that was being done to set up a GOV.UK taxonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year or so earlier, the Finding Things team &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/06/29/finding-things-how-were-breaking-down-the-silos-on-gov-uk/&quot;&gt;started developing a new subject-matter taxonomy for GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt;. The aim was to set up 19 large themes, working with departments and agencies to get everything organised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team started with the Education topic and built a tree-structure taxonomy, with a number of ‘sub-branches’ or sub-topics. Things like ‘Education of disadvantaged children’ and ‘Funding and finance for students’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this work was going well, it was taking quite a long time and was very resource and engagement heavy - both for us at GDS and for the departments we were working with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supervised machine learning could dramatically speed up this approach and, we hoped, help get a topic taxonomy with all existing content tagged to it in a matter of months rather than years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we did&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2018/10/08/data-science-is-a-team-sport/&quot;&gt;data science is a team sport&lt;/a&gt;, we embedded in the existing team that was building the taxonomy and worked with them to build a robust model. We used these 3 data sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the taxonomy tree structure and all the sub-branch levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a sample of GOV.UK pages that had already been tagged and organised in sub-branches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a lot more pages that were not tagged or organised at all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could use the pages that had already been tagged to train an algorithm to recognise patterns in the page contents. We could then use this algorithm to predict the correct tags for the pages that had not yet been organised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing&quot;&gt;Natural Language Processing&lt;/a&gt; to make the text content on the page machine readable. We used this and the page metadata (like date published and department) to learn patterns that could be used to predict which sub-branches an untagged page should be organised in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, a GOV.UK page is tagged to more than one sub-branch, so we implemented a multilabel model to be able to do exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, as the taxonomy tree is constantly being curated and improved by content designers, our model needed to be easily adaptable to changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had about 100,000 untagged pages to tag and we aimed to tag them with around 210 sub-branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-6624 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2018/10/image1-620x413.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A sign reading &#39;data science&#39;&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;413&quot; srcset=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2018/10/image1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2018/10/image1-310x207.jpg 310w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2018/10/image1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2018/10/image1-435x290.jpg 435w, https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2018/10/image1.jpg 1999w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How the work went&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To choose a supervised learning algorithm for the job, we first used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/EpistasisLab/tpot&quot;&gt;TPOT&lt;/a&gt;. This is a Python tool that explores thousands of possible combinations to pick the best algorithm for your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network&quot;&gt;Convolutional Neural Network&lt;/a&gt; - a type of deep learning algorithm - outperformed all the classical algorithms that TPOT explored. So we started with &lt;a href=&quot;https://livebook.manning.com/#!/book/deep-learning-with-python/chapter-6/326&quot;&gt;this simple architecture&lt;/a&gt;. But we had to do &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-taxonomy-supervised-learning&quot;&gt;quite a bit of iteration to get it right&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the first time we ran the algorithm, it took a page with the title ‘Government launches its first ever national bowel cancer campaign’ and suggested the tag ‘counter-terrorism’. So clearly we needed to tweak it a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found the algorithm was overfitting - in other words it had learned too much and it needed to forget a bit. So we changed the settings and fine-tuned our parameters and then tried again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, we got the suggested tag National Health Service and Public Health. Success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rolling the work out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We put our results in front of user researchers and content designers on GOV.UK and they were very happy. In a couple of sub-branches with few training examples, or very diverse content, the model did not perform sufficiently well. So we ignored the predictions to those sub-branches and started to roll it out everywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using machine learning we have managed to tag 96% of the untagged pages on GOV.UK - that’s roughly 100,000 pages. And we are now able to predict a sub-branch for new content coming in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unlocking more work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have a draft taxonomy of everything and nearly all the content on GOV.UK is organised within it. The full taxonomy has been released to publishers to use and at GDS we are putting governance in place to allow for constant improvement and iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also running experiments on how auto suggestions might work in the publishing applications. Our ambition is that the whole site can be powered by a reliable and continually improving taxonomy - and we can suggest tags for new content to publishers as it is created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having this fundamental structure in place and the ability to evolve it has unlocked all of the other work we’re doing on GOV.UK - such as step by step journeys and voice activation. And by using machine learning we have made this process quick and easy both for us and the publishers across government we work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;One of the questions the data science team at the Government Digital Service (GDS) often gets asked is ‘how does your team work on data science projects?’ We thought we’d blog about how we have evolved our approach to data science projects and what we’ve learned during that time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;The data science team started at GDS more than 4 years ago as a handful of data scientists and policy advisors. Our aim was to practically demonstrate to senior stakeholders across government the opportunity for data science and support departments’ strategic ambitions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Our initial work focused on rapid prototyping to show what was possible to inform policy issues. Although these outputs were statistically robust and helped shape strategic thinking, it rarely progressed to a scalable product or service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;A lot has changed since then. The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;ONS Data Science Campus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; has joined us and the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-office-for-science&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Government Office for Science&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; in supporting capability development through the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/07/20/building-capability-and-community-through-the-government-data-science-partnership/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Government Data Science Partnership&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;We’ve grown our data science community to more than 1,200 people across the public sector and the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-science-accelerator-programme/introduction-to-the-data-science-accelerator&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Data Science Accelerator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; has seen some 100 analysts graduate - with many going on to become data scientists in their organisations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Within GDS our range of platforms, products and services have developed to the point where machine learning can be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/06/27/building-the-gov-uk-of-the-future/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;applied at scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; and shape product roadmaps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Along the way we’ve learned from others in industry and government, and from our own experiences on what it takes to apply data science. We’re now seeing parts of government &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalpeople.blog.gov.uk/2018/07/10/dwp-digital-our-data-products-cross-boundaries-creating-informed-policies/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;succeed with data science&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; in large part by building an appropriate team. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;As a result of our experiences we have 3 important lessons:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;A multidisciplinary team is essential.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Data science is not the product.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;One product or service at a time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;A multidisciplinary team is essential&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;The initiation of a data science project can come from many places. It could be a query from a minister, an urgent operational need or just an opportunity someone spots for using an innovative approach. Often to meet the user need, it requires a new product or service to be built. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;This new product or service usually begins with a discovery phase with user research, an exploration of data, potential techniques and proof of concepts. However, the next step to building an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;alpha prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; - and potentially onto a scaled &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-beta-phase-works&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;beta product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; - is where development can stall due to a lack of the right skills or capacity in the delivery team.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;In the worst case, the team may attempt to make the leap from early prototype to a live product. This is nearly guaranteed to fail through design flaws, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.06766v1.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;single points of failure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/thoughts-on-software-development-heroes-5ec656c2e31a&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;hero coding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;The need for a multidisciplinary team is so crucial it is assessed in detail in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/have-a-multidisciplinary-team#related-guides&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;the Digital Service Standard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;. Having a diverse range of specialist skills and experiences has been a noted factor in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4852640/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;high-performing teams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236144612_Evolving_Behavioral_Specialization_in_Robot_Teams_to_Solve_a_Collective_Construction_Task&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;even teams of robot workers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; given construction tasks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;So if you have ambitions to scale machine learning and broader artificial intelligence (AI) applications in your organisation then ignoring this principle has consequences. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;A team of data scientists is not a data science team. When a team only consists of data scientist (or closely related) roles, the team will adapt to cover roles like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework#product-and-delivery:-delivery-manager-&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;delivery manager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework#user-centred-design:-user-researcher&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;user researcher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; or an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework#user-centred-design:-interaction-designer-&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;interaction designer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;. This team model does not make the most of the data scientist&#39;s technical skills in machine learning and AI, and can lead to ‘data scientist’ roles being filled by individuals who do not meet the actual &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-scientist-role-description&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;role requirements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;. This undermines the value data scientists bring to an organisation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;At GDS we now embed data scientists in existing product and service teams. This ensures the data scientist can focus on using their specialist knowledge and make use of functional overlaps of roles like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework#technical:-software-developer-&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;software developer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework#data:-data-engineer&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;data engineer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework#data:-performance-analyst&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;performance analyst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;. This increases the pace of delivery and means learning occurs where there are skills and knowledge overlaps between specialists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Data science is not the product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;One of our strategic aims as a team at GDS has been to reduce our efforts on ‘pretty’ data science that uses single page applications for data visualisations and dashboards. These have value in communicating the data story but should not dominate a data scientist’s time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Instead, we try to focus on applying machine learning to existing products and services where it has matured to the point where machine learning and AI can usefully be applied. This follows the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/the-ai-hierarchy-of-needs-18f111fcc007&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;data science hierarchy of needs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;The current AI technology marketing can mean the output of data scientists is seen as the product - but this is wrong. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Machine-learning-as-a-service commercial offerings pitch AI as the product, but for digital services in government the work that data scientists do is only part of the product. There is a much wider set of roles and thinking that needs to happen to make a product that meets the user need.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;One product or service at a time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;There is wealth of evidence that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Brooks-Mythical-Man-Month-The-Essays-on-Software-Engineering-Anniversary-Edition-2nd-Edition/PGM172844.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;focused activity is a hallmark of successful teams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;, so avoiding partial allocation of specialist time is preferable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;At GDS we’re trying to build more resilience into the work of our data scientists. In the first instance we are trying to ensure data scientists can focus on a single piece of work as part of a much bigger team. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;As a data science function, we’re using retrospectives and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://labs.spotify.com/2014/09/16/squad-health-check-model/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;team health checks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; to make sure data scientists can share issues and identify collective opportunities to improve how we work. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;We’re also trialling team designs that embed data scientists in pairs where possible. By pairing up and following the ‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2011/06/21/two-is-one-and-one-is-none/#683136a48a8c&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;two is one and one is none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;’ pattern we can apply data scientists with a mix of technical skills and experience. This supports team resilience and knowledge sharing that goes beyond the functional practices like version control and team stand-ups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;Following these 3 lessons when tackling data science opportunities requires leadership above the team who can recognise when and how data scientists can add value to products and services. Being mindful of technology hype cycles and avoiding &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30215394&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt;doing 30% too much&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400&quot;&gt; means we can realise the opportunity for data science to be pervasive and transformational.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At GDS we’ve brought together a range of elements that teams can use to make sure their services look and operate consistently with the rest of GOV.UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes things like typography guidelines, form elements and standardised buttons. We currently host these things on &lt;a href=&quot;http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;GOV.UK Elements&lt;/a&gt; and we’re building the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/10/30/building-the-gov-uk-design-system/&quot;&gt;GOV.UK Design System&lt;/a&gt;, which is where they will sit in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because these elements are being used by different teams across government, we need to make sure that accessibility is – as far as possible – built into them. We also want to create a foundation for the GOV.UK Design System team, who can continue to make sure they’re accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my Accessibility team colleague Richard Morton and I carried out an audit of all the things we have in GOV.UK Elements. We fixed what we were able to and reported what we weren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we did and what we found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing the elements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to look at more than 40 different elements and components. And we needed to test a lot of these elements in context. For example, it is very difficult to test an input field on its own – you need to have it in a form with all the usual interaction in order to test it more reliably. To do this, we built a very simple prototype to test all the elements on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then carried out a range of different tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first, we checked all the prototype pages against the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag&quot;&gt;WCAG guidelines&lt;/a&gt; – we looked at every single success criterion to see if there was a pass or a fail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we then tested the pages with various &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies#what-to-test&quot;&gt;assistive technologies&lt;/a&gt; – we have 2 laptops in our office that have the necessary technologies, including multiple versions of JAWS, NVDA, Dragon NaturallySpeaking and ZoomText and we also tested in VoiceOver on iPhone, iPad and Mac&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we ran some other tests – including inverting colours with ZoomText, modifying colour schemes with browser settings, using a monochromatic filter, checking that links make sense out of context, and checking HTML validity and if things work without JavaScript, without CSS and without both&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in a few complex cases, we also did some user research with screen reader users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up investigating 38 different issues. The vast majority of them (24) turned out to be about forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some of the things we found and fixed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;JAWS and NVDA in IE11 couldn’t open content in the progressive disclosure element&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/typography/#typography-hidden-text&quot;&gt;progressive disclosure element&lt;/a&gt; is used for hiding content on page load and then showing it when a user is interested and activates the trigger. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/440&quot;&gt;When using JAWS or NVDA in IE11, this component didn’t work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because the component was triggered using the ‘keyup’, ‘keypress’ and ‘mouseup’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOM_events&quot;&gt;DOM events&lt;/a&gt;, but JAWS and NVDA in IE11 only recognise the ‘click’ event. We could quickly fix this by simply changing the event handler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Errors in forms were not always clear to screen reader users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a form can’t be submitted due to an error, it is important that the user knows as soon as possible that something went wrong. To make sure that happens, every error is highlighted within the form, there is a big error summary box at the top of the page and we move keyboard focus to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, we found that browser or screen reader bugs meant that these things were not always obvious to screen reader users, who would have to peruse the page fully to pick them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we implemented one additional way for users to be alerted to the problem on the page. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/509&quot;&gt;We added the word “Error” into the page title whenever there was a problem on the page&lt;/a&gt;. For many screen readers the page title is the very first thing they read out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a tiny change with a big effect. When we user-tested this, the positive reaction was overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_870&quot; style=&quot;width: 630px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-870&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-870 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2018/02/safari-screen-with-vo-e1467359930665.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;388&quot; srcset=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2018/02/safari-screen-with-vo-e1467359930665.png 620w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2018/02/safari-screen-with-vo-e1467359930665-310x194.png 310w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-870&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A screenshot of the VoiceOver screenreader in use on a Mac&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Screen readers read headings out twice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that headings on form pages &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/507&quot;&gt;were often read out twice by screen readers&lt;/a&gt;. This was happening when we followed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2015/07/03/one-thing-per-page/&quot;&gt;‘one thing per page’ pattern&lt;/a&gt; and had a page with a single question as the h1 as well as the hidden legend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question h1 heading – for example ‘do you already have an account?’ – would be at the top of the page and would be followed by 2 radio buttons saying ‘yes’ and ‘no’, and a ‘submit’ button. The problem arose because you still need a legend for screen readers to explain what the radio buttons are referring to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solving this proved quite tricky. We felt it would be best if the legend and the h1 were the same. So why not move the heading into the legend? We started to explore that option, which would intentionally produce invalid HTML. As we were doing this, though, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#the-legend-element&quot;&gt;the W3C made it valid in the HTML5.2 spec&lt;/a&gt;. This solution wouldn’t have been possible without that change in the spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might still show up as invalid in older validators or if you’re validating against an older HTML version. But when we tested this in all the assistive technology available to us, it behaved the best out of all alternatives we tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hacking the HTML can be ok&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should generally avoid having any invalid HTML because it can cause unpredictable issues in anything that consumes it, including browsers and assistive technologies. But sometimes it is not just ok to have invalid HTML, it can also make the user experience better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the ‘autocomplete’ attribute on inputs used to be invalid but it was generally accepted that it was still better to have it for security reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only invalid HTML that still exists in GOV.UK Elements is the pattern attribute on the&lt;a href=&quot;http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/form-elements/example-date/&quot;&gt; date pattern example&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve kept this in because iOS devices still don’t show the number keyboard on a number input. This little hack(ish) forces the number keyboard to be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe this is a good use of a hack because it provides a much better user experience than using the standard keyboard. And we haven’t found any negative effects in browsers and assistive technologies we’ve tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this clear, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/556&quot;&gt;we documented why we include this hack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Browser bugs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the 38 accessibility issues in GOV.UK Elements we found and investigated, 12 were about actual problems with the code, 8 about guidance, 2 were non-issues and 16 were about browser bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we encounter browser bugs or bugs with any assistive technology, we make sure to report them. For example, we did this when we discovered that some elements would become invisible or unrecognisable &lt;a href=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/27/how-users-change-colours-on-websites/&quot;&gt;when changing colours&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some organisations’ bug trackers are open (like Mozilla’s bug tracker) but many are not, which makes it difficult to track the report’s progress. &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/How_to_file_ARIA-related_bugs&quot;&gt;This article on Mozilla’s developer site lists where to report bugs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During testing for accessibility issues in GOV.UK Elements, we found 19 vendor bugs and reported most of them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;11 in VoiceOver (6 in iOS and 3 in macOS, 2 in both)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 in IE/Edge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 in recent Dragon NaturallySpeaking and 2 in an older version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 in Firefox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 in an older version of JAWS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(These numbers don’t add up because for some issues we reported more than one bug and some bugs were happening in more than one browser or assistive technology.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Build in accessibility from the start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to support teams across government as much as possible to build accessible services. That’s why we’ve worked so hard to make sure the elements and components we publish are as accessible as they can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But using these tools alone won’t prevent accessibility issues. Teams should also make sure they are running their own testing on services as well as carrying out user research with people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making things accessible is the job of all of us. And only by working together and supporting each other can we ensure that government services are accessible by default.&lt;/p&gt;

The posters are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/tree/master/accessibility&quot;&gt;available to download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the GOV.UK Publishing Frontend team we’ve worked to turn small, repeated elements of our pages into components. A component is a chunk of code written in a consistent way that can be easily reused across GOV.UK without having to duplicate anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This consistent approach includes the structure of the code, tests, file locations and documentation. It also includes accessibility criteria that make sure the component is as usable as possible. Using a consistent approach makes it easier to maintain and improve components and pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making web pages that work across every current browser and device is difficult. Making those pages accessible adds another level of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that much of what defines ‘accessibility’ can’t be tested automatically and isn’t based on a specific, ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution. For example, a bug in JavaScript will cause an error that can be diagnosed and fixed, but an accessibility issue such as a confusingly worded sentence is harder to identify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing with real users in real-life scenarios is often the only way to be certain that a page or a component is truly accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the components we recently worked on is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/driving-lessons-learning-to-drive/taking-driving-lessons&quot;&gt;next/previous navigation&lt;/a&gt; that occurs at the foot of some GOV.UK pages. Here’s how we made this component accessible to screen reader users and what we learned about accessibility in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Uncovering the issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next/previous navigation shows users what pages come before and after the page they are currently on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-831 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2017/12/image3.png&quot; alt=&quot;An image showing &#39;previous&#39; and &#39;next&#39; on one line of navigation and &#39;overview&#39; and &#39;practising with family or friends&#39; on the next line&quot; width=&quot;749&quot; height=&quot;138&quot; srcset=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2017/12/image3.png 749w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2017/12/image3-310x57.png 310w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2017/12/image3-620x114.png 620w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we tested the component using a screen reader we noticed a possible issue. For sighted users the distinction between the navigation text (‘Previous’ and ‘Next’) and the link label text (‘Overview’ and ‘Practising with family or friends’) was clear. This was because the font size was different and the two pieces of text were on separate lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user who relied on a screen reader didn’t have that distinction. There was no pause between the navigation text and link text when they were read out, leading to a possible confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing screen readers to explore the issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most screen readers recognise punctuation. We decided to see if there was any way we could use some to provide an audible pause between the navigation text and the link label text. This punctuation would have to be invisible to all but screen readers so as to not change the appearance of the component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used VoiceOver (the built-in screen reader for Mac), Jaws (Windows), NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access for Windows) and Narrator (the built-in screen reader for Windows) for our testing. We built a simple page containing 11 variations of the component with various punctuation characters invisibly inserted to see how each screen reader would handle them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tried the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no punctuation (the current, live version of the component)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;punctuation characters in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/places-its-tempting-to-use-display-none-but-dont/&quot;&gt;visually hidden element&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The punctuation characters we tested were colon, period, comma, dash and a unicode character for a right arrow. We listened to each screen reader as it navigated our test page, noting whether or not it paused at the required place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_830&quot; style=&quot;width: 768px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-830&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-830 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2017/12/image2.png&quot; alt=&quot;A test page showing 3 different navigation options - one with no hidden punctuation, one with a hidden colon and one with a hidden period&quot; width=&quot;758&quot; height=&quot;426&quot; srcset=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2017/12/image2.png 758w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2017/12/image2-310x174.png 310w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2017/12/image2-620x348.png 620w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-830&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Screenshot of our test page built to see how different screen readers handle hidden punctuation marks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Screen reader behaviour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get to the results, it&#39;s worth pointing out some screen reader behaviour we noticed during testing that may be unfamiliar to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some screen readers pronounced certain punctuation characters and others didn’t. For example, Jaws pronounced colons and semicolons but NVDA didn’t, instead inserting a pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VoiceOver had quite complex rules around if and how it pronounced the period character. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a normal end to a sentence followed by another sentence, such as “ending. This” is pronounced “ending (pause) This”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“. this” is pronounced “dot this”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“. This” is pronounced “full stop This”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second 2 examples aren’t likely to appear on most web pages but they show the value of checking your content thoroughly. Even if text makes sense when you read it, this doesn’t mean it will come across exactly as intended when read by a screen reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some screen readers pronounce the first word of a sentence in a way that makes it clear that it’s the start of a sentence. This helps the user to understand the structure of the text, particularly if they have increased the reading speed. Jaws appears to rely solely on this when reading aloud as it does not pause between sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more about screen reader behaviour in our blog post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/08/advice-for-creating-content-that-works-well-with-screen-readers/&quot;&gt;how to create content that works well with screen readers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The best solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that most of the screen readers behaved differently when using hidden punctuation. Sometimes they would pause, sometimes they would pronounce the character out loud, or sometimes they simply wouldn’t pause at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The punctuation characters that most consistently produced a pause were colon, full stop and comma. The comma produced a pause consistently in all screen readers that we tested. Based on these results, it seemed a hidden element containing a comma would be the best solution. Unfortunately accessibility isn’t always that simple. Grammatically speaking, a colon makes more sense. Contrast these two examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previous, Terrorism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previous: Terrorism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although some screen readers will pronounce the colon rather than pausing, we decided to implement this solution as it makes more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it says in &lt;a href=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/08/advice-for-creating-content-that-works-well-with-screen-readers/&quot;&gt;the blog post about creating content that works well with screen readers&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Don&#39;t write content that works specifically for screen readers, write content that works well for everyone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The value of accessibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a screen reader user you can hopefully appreciate this small improvement on GOV.UK right now. We’ve also made sure that this work is clearly documented so that it can’t be overlooked and accidentally removed in any future work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may seem like a lot of effort, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/static/commit/5a830ff1be36dda99a7015986b34c1cbf8895360&quot;&gt;the solution was simple to implement&lt;/a&gt; and we learned a lot about screen readers in the process. Accessibility is often disregarded as unnecessary or too complicated to do right, but hopefully this example has shown that it’s worthwhile and achievable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work was done in collaboration with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/communities/accessibility-community&quot;&gt;cross-government accessibility community&lt;/a&gt;, who gave considerable insight into this issue. This included insight from people who use a screen reader on a daily basis. We’ll be continuing to look at how accessibility can be improved in small and large ways across GOV.UK.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We recently conducted an audit of automated accessibility testing tools. We built a website full of accessibility failures to test them on. &lt;a href=&quot;https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-tool-audit/&quot;&gt;We&#39;ve published our findings here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog post we talk about what we did and what we discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The pros and cons of automated tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automated accessibility testing tools can be used to identify accessibility issues on websites. As the name suggests, they are automated tools that can be run on websites and can identify a number of issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several available, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://wave.webaim.org/extension/&quot;&gt;Wave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://tenon.io/&quot;&gt;Tenon&lt;/a&gt;. Many of them are free and can be accessed online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automated tools can be a useful and cheap way of helping you make a service more accessible. They are quick to run and provide immediate feedback. They can be run across lots of pages. Some can be integrated into the build process, so they can identify issues almost as soon as they are created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while it can certainly be helpful to run an automated testing tool on a service, it’s important that teams don’t rely on them too heavily. No tool will be able to pick up every accessibility barrier on a website. So just because a tool hasn’t picked up any accessibility issues on a website, doesn’t mean those issues don’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even if they do detect a barrier, sometimes the results they give will be inconclusive or require further investigation. Or even just wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good analogy is to think of a testing tool as like using a spellchecker. It can certainly help you pick up issues, but it should never be used in isolation. To be most useful, automated tools should be combined with manual inspection and user research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help people understand the usefulness – and the limitations – of automated tools, and to help people pick a suitable tool, we carried out an audit of some of the most common tools available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choosing the tools to test with&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose 10 automated testing tools for our audit. We wanted to test the tools that are most commonly used by developers and quality assurance testers. And we wanted to test a large enough number of tools that we would get a variety of results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We picked all the free tools we were aware of. We also sought suggestions through the cross-government &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/forum/?hl=en-GB#!forum/accessibility-community&quot;&gt;Accessibility Google Group&lt;/a&gt;. Here are the tools we tested:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tenon.io&quot;&gt;Tenon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wave.webaim.org/extension/&quot;&gt;Wave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://squizlabs.github.io/HTML_CodeSniffer/&quot;&gt;HTML Codesniffer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deque.com/products/axe/&quot;&gt;aXe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php&quot;&gt;AChecker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.powermapper.com/products/sortsite/&quot;&gt;Sort Site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-developer-t/fpkknkljclfencbdbgkenhalefipecmb?hl=en&quot;&gt;Google Accessibility Developer Tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://checkers.eiii.eu/&quot;&gt;The European Internet Inclusion Initiative’s page checker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://asqatasun.org/&quot;&gt;Asqatasun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://validator.w3.org/nu/&quot;&gt;Nu HTML Checker&lt;/a&gt; (this is an HTML validator – we were interested in seeing what accessibility issues it might pick up)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these tools are free to use, apart from Sort Site, which has a free trial. Tenon and Wave also have paid versions if you don’t want to run them in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing on the world’s least accessible web page&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we had decided which tools to work with, we needed a web page to test them on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We needed a page that was riddled with accessibility problems. One that broke all the accessibility rules. One that featured all kinds of accessibility barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we built one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_707&quot; style=&quot;width: 1450px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-707&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-707 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-23-at-13.30.18.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of &#39;the world&#39;s least accessible website&#39;, which we built to test automated tools on&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height=&quot;802&quot; srcset=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-23-at-13.30.18.png 1440w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-23-at-13.30.18-310x173.png 310w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-23-at-13.30.18-768x428.png 768w, https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-23-at-13.30.18-620x345.png 620w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px&quot; /&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-707&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A screenshot of &#39;the world&#39;s least accessible website&#39;, which we built to test automated tools on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dugboticus?lang=en&quot;&gt;Alistair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/accessibleweb&quot;&gt;Richard&lt;/a&gt;, my colleagues on the GDS Accessibility team, to create &lt;a href=&quot;https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-tool-audit/test-cases.html&quot;&gt;a web-page full of accessibility failures&lt;/a&gt;. We refer to it as the world’s least accessible web page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We filled it with accessibility barriers. At the moment it contains a total of 143 failures grouped into 19 categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failures include things like images without alt attributes, or with the wrong alt attributes, and blank link text. We also put in a number of things that we thought testing tools probably wouldn’t be able to detect, but are also accessibility issues. Things like flashing content that didn’t carry a warning, or plain language not being used in content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew there was no way we could put in every potential accessibility barrier, but we wanted to have enough on the page so that we could adequately test how useful the tools were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then ran the tools against the page, to find out how many of the failures they would pick up and how many they would miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-tool-audit/index.html&quot;&gt;You can see our findings in detail here&lt;/a&gt;. Here are the main things we discovered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lots of the barriers weren’t found by any of the tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that a large proportion of the barriers we created weren’t picked up by any of the 10 tools we tested – 29% in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 143 barriers we created, a total of 42 were missed by all of the tools we tested. The ones that were missed included barriers such as italics used on long sections of text, tables with empty cells and links identified by colour alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when barriers were found, the error reporting process wasn’t always clear-cut. Sometimes the tools would show a warning or call for manual inspection, without explicitly saying there was an error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;There is a huge range in the effectiveness of the tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also found that some of the tools picked up more errors than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we only count error messages and warnings, then Tenon picked up the most barriers – it found 37% of them. If we also count manual inspection prompts, then Asqatasun was the most effective – it found 41% of the barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the range, Google Developer Tools, which is quite a popular tool, only picked up 17% of the barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that using tools in combination could help you pick up more barriers, but doing this can be harder and less cost-effective for teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The effectiveness of the tools is just one of the things teams need to consider&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found a big range in terms of the effectiveness of the tools. But, as well as effectiveness, we also know that there are other considerations teams will take into account when deciding whether or not to use a tool, and which tool to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that the tools have to be easy to set up and run. And the results they give have to be clear and easy to act on. As well as being used by developers they may be used by non-technical people in teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other technical considerations to take into account too. For example, some tools might not work on password-protected pages. And some might not test on mobile pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of our work, &lt;a href=&quot;https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-tool-audit/&quot;&gt;we gathered contextual information about the tools&lt;/a&gt; to help teams make a decision on which ones suited them best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How best to use automated tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our opinion of automated testing tools is the same after the audit as it was before. We think they are very useful and should definitely be used by teams to pick up issues. But also that they cannot be relied on, by themselves, to check the accessibility of a website. They are most effective when combined with manual testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research backs this up. While the tools picked up the majority of the accessibility barriers we created – 71% – there was a large minority that would only have been picked up by manual checking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most effective accessibility testing, we advise teams to combine automated tool testing with manual checking, an accessibility audit and user testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that our result pages will help teams pick a tool that best meets their needs. And will also encourage tool creators to better document what the tools can and can&#39;t do.&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2016-12-15 14:20:13 UTC</updated>
		
		<content type="html">
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-641 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2016/12/oie_717206RSdEJn2R-5.gif&quot; alt=&quot;An animated image of a screen recording showing keyboard-only and screen reader use on a webchat. There is a conversation window, in which an adviser is asking how they can help the user. The screen reader text overlay, from macOS VoiceOver, is clear to see and reads out the content of the chat window and the adviser&#39;s message. The user selects the input field, which uses a hidden label that’s read out by the screen reader in the visible text overlay. The user types in a message and activates the submit button, which is nearby. Sending the message makes the screen reader text overlay send confirmation that the message has been sent. The animation then loops again from the beginning&quot; width=&quot;1194&quot; height=&quot;695&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m a developer at the Government Digital Service and I work with a team that, earlier this year, built a custom prototype webchat, &lt;a href=&quot;https://governmentasaplatform.blog.gov.uk/2016/07/25/creating-patterns-for-live-chat-on-the-web/&quot;&gt;as part of the webchat alpha&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We looked at which technologies help make webchat software more usable with screen readers. This blog post talks about what we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why we focused on screen readers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s be clear, there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/02/dos-and-donts-on-designing-for-accessibility/&quot;&gt;more to accessibility than just screen readers&lt;/a&gt;. Other accessibility needs are better met by improvements in visual design and content design. Users with visual impairments for example, may benefit from more accessible visual design, while users with dyslexia may benefit from accessible content design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screen readers are slightly different because they can be made to work better with very specific web platform technologies that are well known and documented, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria&quot;&gt;WAI-ARIA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some of our most important findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buttons and labels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labels provide context for screen readers so that they can tell users which options are available to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your message submission field doesn’t have a visible label, you should use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/hiding-content-for-accessibility&quot;&gt;hidden label&lt;/a&gt;. These hidden labels, combined with HTML button elements, make navigating and operating webchat easier for users with screen readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aria-live&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wrapped sections of our webchat prototype in &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions&quot;&gt;aria-live regions&lt;/a&gt;. Aria-live regions allow us to communicate changes to the user journey directly to the user during a webchat. For example, if a user is waiting in a queue, they’ll be told if their position in the queue changes. Aria-live regions can also be used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to tell users when an advisor is typing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to tell users when an adviser goes offline or becomes unavailable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to notify users that the webchat feature has appeared on the page since they first landed on the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when receiving a new chat message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful not to overwhelm your user with too many notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that different screen readers have different behaviours when a new item is placed inside an aria-live container. It was important for us to test this with several assistive technologies. We found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VoiceOver for Safari (OSX 10.11) will interrupt a screen reader with an aria-live notification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NVDA for Windows 7 on FireFox and IE11 will queue the new aria-live notification until the after the current announcement has ended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Audio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use sound to improve accessibility too. Sounds can help us communicate changes during the webchat. If someone is moving up in a queue or receiving a new message, we can signal this with a particular sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we also make sure that no information is communicated based on sound alone, so we don’t exclude users who are hard of hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aria-label&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-label_attribute&quot;&gt;aria-labels&lt;/a&gt; on elements that don&#39;t have enough descriptive text and therefore rely on positioning or context to convey their purpose. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘Minimise the webchat’ is better than ‘Hide’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘Close the webchat’ is better than ‘Close’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If elements don’t have enough descriptive text on them, you can add additional words into the aria-labels to make it easier for the user to understand. ‘Tom said: How can I help’ is more conversational than ‘Tom: How can I help.’ But our testing showed this isn’t always the best option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try out alternatives and see what works best for your particular user journey. If the webchats are likely to consist of lots of messages between the user and adviser, then paraphrasing might get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Skiplinks and focus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/&quot;&gt;Skiplinks&lt;/a&gt; are internal page links (or shortcuts) which help users navigate around the current page or interface. You can implement skiplinks that allow the user to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go straight to the webchat window&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go straight to the message submission field when they’ve finished inputting their message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go straight to the “Yes” option when asking the user if they want to end the chat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These patterns will make your webchat more accessible, but these alone are not enough. &lt;a href=&quot;https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/02/dos-and-donts-on-designing-for-accessibility/&quot;&gt;Make sure that your visual design and content design are of a high standard&lt;/a&gt;. Crucially, test your implementation of these accessibility patterns with users who have access needs.&lt;/p&gt;
